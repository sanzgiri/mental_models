# Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

 **Title: Understanding the Power of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**

The mental model of a **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy** is a fascinating and crucial concept that explains how our beliefs and expectations can shape our reality, often creating outcomes that were initially anticipated. This psychological phenomenon has significant implications in various aspects of life, from personal decision-making to societal structures and historical events.

**Core Concept:**
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that comes true, at least in part, due to an individual or group's belief or expectation that the prediction would come true. This phenomenon relies on the powerful interaction between expectations, beliefs, and actions, where people tend to act in ways that make their expectations come true. The self-fulfilling prophecy is a part of the broader concept of positive feedback loops, reinforcing the initial belief or expectation.

**Examples:**
1. **Bank Run (Robert K. Merton):** In Merton's illustration, rumors about a local bank's impending bankruptcy led to mass withdrawals, ultimately causing the bank to go bankrupt due to insufficient liquidity. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfillment.
2. **Pygmalion Effect (Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson):** In this experiment, teachers were told that a random selection of students were expected to perform exceptionally well. To the researchers' surprise, those students showed a significant increase in test scores at the end of the year.
3. **The United States' Invasion of Iraq (2003):** The invasion was based on the assumption that Iraq posed a terrorist threat to the United States. However, evidence suggests no such threat existed initially. The invasion and subsequent overthrowing of the Ba'athist regime created the conditions for an insurgency, thus fulfilling the initial belief of a potential threat.

**Application:**
Understanding self-fulfilling prophecies can help individuals make more informed decisions and navigate their lives effectively. By recognizing how our beliefs and expectations influence our actions and reality, we can strive to maintain a positive mindset and avoid self-sabotaging behaviors. Furthermore, understanding this concept can empower us to break free from harmful stereotypes and challenge limiting beliefs that hold us back.
