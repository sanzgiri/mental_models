 **The 1% Rule: An Intriguing Insight into Online Community Participation**

The 1% Rule is a captivating mental model that sheds light on the dynamic of participation within an Internet community. Coined by authors Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba, this rule suggests that only 1% of users actively create new content, while the remaining 99% are merely consumers of that content.

**Core Concept**

At its core, the 1% Rule is a testament to the unequal distribution of participation in online communities. This phenomenon was first documented by Will Hill of AT&T Laboratories and later popularized by Jakob Nielsen, who termed it "participation inequality." The rule is often misconstrued as applying to the Internet in its entirety, but it pertains specifically to individual Internet communities.

**Examples**

1. **Forums and Online Communities:** In a study of radical jihadist Internet forums, only 1% of users were found to have posted more than 500 times, while 87% had never posted at all. Similarly, in health-oriented online forums, a handful of "Superusers" were found to generate the vast majority of content.
2. **Social Media Platforms:** On platforms like Twitter and Facebook, a small percentage of users create the bulk of the content. This is evident when looking at popular hashtags or trending topics, where a few influential accounts drive the conversation.
3. **Wikis and Collaborative Websites:** In collaborative websites such as wikis, 90% of participants only consume content, 9% change or update it, and 1% add new content.

**Application**

Understanding the 1% Rule can help individuals and organizations navigate online communities more effectively. For instance, businesses might focus their engagement strategies on those who create content (the 1%), understanding that reaching a larger audience requires creating engaging content that resonates with these key contributors. Similarly, in personal contexts, this rule can help users identify influential voices within a community and engage with them to amplify their own impact.
