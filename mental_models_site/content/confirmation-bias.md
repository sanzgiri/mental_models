# Confirmation Bias

 **Introduction**

Confirmation Bias is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to favor information that supports their prior beliefs or values, while disregarding or dismissing contradictory evidence. This mental model plays a significant role in shaping our decisions, opinions, and understanding of the world around us, making it crucial to acknowledge and mitigate its effects.

**Core Concept**

Confirmation bias manifests itself in three main ways: biased search for information, biased interpretation of information, and biased recall of information. People display this bias by seeking evidence that confirms their existing beliefs, interpreting ambiguous evidence in a way that supports their views, and selectively remembering information that aligns with their prior assumptions. The effect is stronger when dealing with emotionally charged issues or deeply entrenched beliefs.

**Examples**

1. **Political Echo Chambers**: In the digital age, social media platforms create filter bubbles, showcasing content that aligns with users' political leanings and hiding opposing viewpoints. This reinforces confirmation bias, as individuals are exposed primarily to information that supports their beliefs.
2. **Scientific Research**: Confirmation bias can lead to systematic errors in scientific research based on inductive reasoning. For example, a researcher might design experiments or interpret results in a way that confirms their initial hypothesis, ignoring contradictory evidence.
3. **Legal Investigations**: Police detectives may focus on a specific suspect early in an investigation and then seek only confirming rather than disconfirming evidence, which can lead to wrongful convictions.

**Application**

To apply the concept of confirmation bias in daily life, one should strive to seek out diverse perspectives, challenge their own beliefs, and consider contradictory evidence when making decisions. This can be achieved by actively seeking out information that disagrees with your current views, questioning your assumptions, and evaluating evidence objectively before drawing conclusions.

**Related Models**

1. [Anchoring](/models/anchoring): Both anchoring and confirmation bias involve a reliance on initial information or beliefs when making decisions. However, while anchoring focuses on the initial piece of information, confirmation bias concerns the tendency to favor evidence that supports existing beliefs.
2. [Cognitive Dissonance](/models/cognitive-dissonance): Confirmation bias is closely related to cognitive dissonance, as both involve a desire to maintain consistency between one's beliefs and actions or new information.
3. [The Dunning-Kruger Effect](/models/dunning-kruger-effect): The Dunning-Kruger effect describes how individuals with low competence suffer from illusory superiority, while those with high competence may be unaware of their abilities. Confirmation bias can contribute to this phenomenon by reinforcing incorrect beliefs about one's abilities.
