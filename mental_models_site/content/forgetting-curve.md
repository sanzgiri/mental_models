# Forgetting Curve

 **Introduction**

The Forgetting Curve is a mental model that delves into the decline of memory retention over time, particularly when no effort is made to retain information. This concept holds significant importance as it sheds light on how our brains process and retain information, ultimately influencing learning strategies, educational methods, and memory enhancement techniques.

**Core Concept**

The Forgetting Curve was first proposed by Hermann Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century based on his self-study of memory retention. He used nonsense syllables (like 'WID' and 'ZOF') to measure memory loss over time, creating a graph that demonstrated how information is halved in recall every few days or weeks without conscious review. Ebbinghaus's work introduced the equation b = 100k/(log(t))^c + k, where b represents the savings (retention rate) and t denotes time in minutes since learning.

**Examples**

1. **Education**: The Forgetting Curve can be observed in classrooms worldwide, as students struggle to retain information without regular revision or practice. Teachers often incorporate spaced repetition and active recall techniques to counteract the effects of the forgetting curve and improve long-term learning outcomes.
2. **Business**: In business settings, the Forgetting Curve can impact employee training programs. Without continuous reinforcement, employees may quickly forget new skills or procedures, leading to decreased productivity over time. Companies use spaced repetition, such as microlearning modules, to combat this issue and ensure long-term retention of essential information.
3. **History**: The Forgetting Curve can be seen in historical events that occurred decades ago but are often misunderstood or misremembered due to the passage of time. For instance, the details of the Kennedy Assassination and 9/11 have been subjects of debate and revision as memories are influenced by subsequent information and personal biases.

**Application**

To apply the Forgetting Curve in daily life, one should prioritize regular review and practice of newly acquired knowledge. This can be achieved through spaced repetition techniques like flashcards, quizzes, or study groups to ensure long-term retention. Additionally, active recall – consciously attempting to retrieve information from memory – has been shown to be more effective than passive reading or rereading for improving memory retention.

**Related Models**

1. **Spacing Effect**: This mental model suggests that dispersing learning over time (spaced repetition) leads to better long-term retention compared to massed practice.
2. **Overlearning**: This concept refers to practicing new skills beyond the point of initial mastery to further cement them in memory and increase resistance to forgetting.
3. **Cognitive Load Theory**: This model focuses on managing the amount of information a learner can process at any given time, aiming to minimize cognitive overload and improve learning outcomes.
