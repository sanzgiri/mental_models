 # Law of Small Numbers: A Powerful Mental Model for Understanding Statistical Anomalies

The **Law of Small Numbers** is a compelling mental model that sheds light on the erroneous interpretations and conclusions often drawn from small data sets or samples. This concept, while not strictly a single mental model, encompasses various ideas related to the misuse of statistical data in limited quantities, leading to hasty generalizations and fallacies.

## Core Concept

The Law of Small Numbers is built around the observation that when working with small data sets, there's a higher likelihood of unusual occurrences or results that may not represent the overall trend or pattern. This is due to the increased variability in smaller samples compared to larger ones. In essence, **the more data points you have, the less likely it is for random fluctuations to dominate the overall picture** [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_small_numbers).

## Examples

1. **Business**: A startup has only 10 customers and observes that 5 of them are from a single city. The company might incorrectly assume that the majority of their potential customer base is located in this one city, even though the sample size is too small to make such assumptions with confidence.
2. **History**: In the 18th century, French mathematician and statistician Laplace claimed that there were only 64 possible combinations for the first three digits of a natural number. This assumption was based on analyzing small numbers, not realizing that as numbers grow, the possibilities become virtually infinite [Source: The Law of Small Numbers by Ladislaus Bortkiewicz].
3. **Life**: A person might believe they have an unusually high chance of getting heads in 10 coin flips if they get heads 7 times, unaware that such a sequence is more likely to occur due to random variation than an actual skew in the outcome.

## Application

In your daily life, be mindful of drawing conclusions from small data sets or samples. Remember, **the less data you have, the greater the chance for misleading insights** [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_small_numbers). To combat this, seek out more information and avoid making hasty generalizations based on limited evidence.
