# Flywheel

 **Introduction**

The mental model known as the Flywheel is a powerful concept that represents an efficient and sustainable means of storing energy, especially in mechanical systems. By understanding the mechanism behind this model and applying it in various aspects of life, one can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and create more resilient systems.

**Core Concept**

At its core, a flywheel is a rotating mechanical device that utilizes the conservation of angular momentum to store rotational energy. This stored energy can be later used to provide a surge in power output when needed or to absorb excess input and smooth out fluctuations in a system's power output. The amount of energy stored by a flywheel is proportional to its moment of inertia (I) and the square of its angular velocity (ω²).

**Examples**

1. **Reciprocating engines**: In internal combustion engines, a crankshaft flywheel stores energy when torque is exerted on it by a firing piston and then returns that energy to the piston to compress a fresh charge of air and fuel. This helps to smooth out power fluctuations and improve engine efficiency.
2. **Friction motors**: Flywheels are used in toys like toy cars, where they store energy during winding and release it to move the vehicle. In this case, the bulk of the mass is toward the rim of the wheel, increasing rotational inertia for a given total mass.
3. **Energy storage systems**: High-performance flywheels made from advanced materials like carbon fiber composites have been proposed for use in vehicle energy storage and braking systems, storing energy during braking and releasing it to propel the vehicle.
4. **Gyroscopes**: Flywheels are used in gyroscopes for instrumentation, ship stability, satellite stabilization (reaction wheel), and other applications where they can control direction or oppose unwanted motions.

**Design**

Flywheel design varies based on the application's requirements. Traditional flywheels have a rim, hub, and spokes, with the majority of the moment of inertia coming from the rim. Shaftless flywheels eliminate the annulus holes, shaft or hub, and use specialized magnetic bearings and control systems to achieve higher energy density. Superflywheels consist of multiple layers of high-strength flexible materials wound around a solid core, allowing for greater energy storage capacity and improved safety in case of failure.

**Applications**

Flywheels have numerous applications in various industries, including providing continuous power output in systems with intermittent energy sources, supplying intermittent pulses of energy at levels exceeding the abilities of their energy source, controlling direction and opposing unwanted motions, and acting as electric compensators to improve power factor or adjust grid voltage.
