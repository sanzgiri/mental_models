# Amygdala Hijack

 **Introduction**

The Amygdala Hijack is a mental model that describes an intense, emotional response disproportionate to the actual stimulus, triggered by the brain's amygdala due to perceived threats. Coined by Daniel Goleman in his 1996 book Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, this model is a cornerstone within affective neuroscience and sheds light on the intricate interplay between emotions and rational thinking. Understanding the Amygdala Hijack can help individuals make informed decisions, manage conflicts, and navigate their personal and professional lives more effectively.

**Core Concept**

The brain is divided into two hemispheres, each containing an amygala – a crucial structure responsible for generating emotions, particularly negative ones like fear. When the brain receives stimuli, part of it goes directly to the amygala, while other parts are sent to the neocortex (the thinking/rational brain). If the amygala perceives a match with its stored memories of threatening situations, it triggers an immediate emotional response through the HPA axis, effectively "hijacking" rational thought. This emotional reaction occurs milliseconds earlier than rational thought, which may lead to irrational or destructive behavior. Goleman likens this process to an evolutionary survival mechanism that prioritizes immediate action over deliberation: "Do I eat it, or does it eat me?"

**Examples**

1. **Business Settings**: Consider a high-pressure meeting where one team member faces criticism for their work. The amygdala hijack may lead the individual to become defensive and react emotionally rather than rationally address the concerns raised by colleagues, potentially causing tension and hindering productive dialogue.
2. **Personal Relationships**: In a heated argument between partners, emotions can take over rational thinking, leading to hurtful words or actions that may damage the relationship. Learning to manage one's emotional responses through self-control is crucial for maintaining harmony and resolving conflicts positively.
3. **Historical Context**: The hijacking of rational thought by the amygala has played a significant role in shaping human history. For example, in times of war or political turmoil, leaders might make rash decisions based on emotional responses to perceived threats, with far-reaching consequences for their nations and the world.

**Application**

Recognizing an amygdala hijack is essential to regaining control over one's emotions and making informed decisions. Mindfulness practices, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can help individuals reconnect with their rational brain and respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively. Developing emotional intelligence skills, like empathy and self-awareness, also aids in understanding and managing the hijack effectively.
