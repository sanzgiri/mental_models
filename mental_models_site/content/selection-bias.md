# Selection Bias

 **Summary of Mental Model "Selection Bias"**

**Introduction:**
Selection bias is a pervasive cognitive distortion that occurs when individuals, groups, or data for analysis are chosen in such a way that the relationship between exposure and outcome among the selected sample differs from the overall population. This mental model matters significantly because it can lead to inaccurate conclusions, misguided decisions, and biased policies if not properly addressed.

**Core Concept:**
Selection bias encompasses several forms, including sampling bias, early termination of trials, susceptibility bias, protopathic bias, indication bias, data partitioning, post hoc alteration of data inclusion, attrition bias, observer selection bias, and Malmquist bias. These biases typically arise when researchers condition on a factor that is influenced both by the exposure and outcome or their causes, creating a false association between them.

**Examples:**
1. **Sampling Bias**: A classic example of sampling bias can be seen in opinion polls. If pollsters only survey people who live in urban areas, they may overlook rural voters, potentially skewing the results towards urban opinions.
2. **Early Termination of Trials**: Consider a clinical trial testing a new cancer treatment. If the study is terminated early due to overwhelming positive results in one group, it may not accurately reflect the treatment's effectiveness over its entire course.
3. **Observer Selection Bias**: In a study on the impact of climate change, if observers are only present in areas less affected by climate change, they might miss critical data points that would reveal more severe effects elsewhere.

**Application:**
Understanding selection bias is crucial for making informed decisions and conducting accurate research. By being aware of potential biases, individuals can take steps to ensure a representative sample, maintain objectivity in data collection, and apply appropriate statistical analyses to account for biases when necessary.

**Related Models:**
1. [Confirmation Bias](/models/confirmation-bias) – the tendency to favor information that confirms one's beliefs or values.
2. [Publication Bias](/models/publication-bias) – the distortion of research findings due to the publication of only positive or significant results.
