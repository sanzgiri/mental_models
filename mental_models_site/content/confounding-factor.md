 # Confounding Factor: Navigating the Complexities of Creativity and Innovation in Video Game Design

The mental model "Confounding Factor" is a concept deeply rooted in the realm of video game design, particularly in the career of Toby Gard, the co-creator of Lara Croft, the iconic protagonist of the Tomb Raider franchise. This mental model encapsulates the challenges and complexities that arise when creativity, commercial success, and creative control intertwine, often leading to unexpected outcomes.

## Core Concept

The Confounding Factor represents the intricate dance between artistic vision, market demands, and business realities in the video game industry. It's a mental model that underscores the importance of maintaining creative control while navigating the commercial pressures that often threaten to dilute original ideas.

## Examples

1. **The Creation of Tomb Raider (1996)**: Gard's work on the original Tomb Raider game, where he was given creative control by Core Design, exemplifies the Confounding Factor. Despite the company's initial interest in marketing Lara Croft for her sex appeal, Gard's vision for Lara as a "cool, collected, in control" character prevailed, ultimately contributing to the game's success and Lara's enduring popularity.
2. **Forming Confounding Factor (1997)**: After losing creative freedom at Core Design, Gard co-founded Confounding Factor with Paul Douglas. The company faced a protracted development period before releasing Galleon on Xbox in 2004. This experience underscores the challenges and uncertainties that come with venturing out on one's own, away from established structures.
3. **Return to Tomb Raider (2006-2010)**: After the closure of Confounding Factor, Gard was re-hired by Eidos Interactive to work on a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. His involvement in various aspects of the production process, from character design to story co-writing, demonstrates the potential for regaining creative control even after a period of loss or compromise.

## Application

Understanding the Confounding Factor can help individuals navigating creative industries maintain their artistic vision while making pragmatic decisions. It emphasizes the importance of knowing when to fight for creative control and when to compromise for the sake of progress or survival. By recognizing and planning for the Confounding Factor, creators can better manage expectations, avoid burnout, and maintain a sense of purpose in their work.
