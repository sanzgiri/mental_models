# Murphy's Law

 **Introduction**

Murphy's Law is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong." This mental model, coined by American aerospace engineer Edward A. Murphy Jr., has become a popular and occasionally misused saying in various technical cultures, especially those related to engineering and project management. The law serves as a humorous reminder of the inherent unpredictability and complexity of systems, urging us to plan for potential failures and mishaps.

**Origins and Evolution**

The origins of Murphy's Law are somewhat disputed, but it is believed that it originated during a project at Edwards Air Force Base in the late 1940s or early 1950s. The law quickly evolved, with variations appearing to apply to different topics and subjects, changing over time. One of the earliest collections of these corollaries was compiled by Arthur Bloch in his book Murphy's Law, and Other Reasons Why Things Go WRONG (1977).

**Key Corollaries and Variations**

- **Murphy's First Law:** Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
- **Yhprum's Law:** Anything that can go right will go right. This is an optimistic reversal of Murphy's law.
- **Drucker's Law:** If one thing goes wrong, everything else will, and at the same time.
- **Mrs. Murphy's Law:** Anything that can go wrong will go wrong while Mr. Murphy is out of town.

**Academic Views and Criticism**

While Murphy's Law has become a common saying in various technical cultures, it has also faced criticism from some academics. Richard Dawkins, for example, argues that the law requires inanimate objects to have desires of their own, or else to react according to one's own desires – an absurd notion, as he points out. David Hand, on the other hand, suggests that the law may be a result of selection bias, whereby we remember and focus on the events that confirm our pre-existing ideas, while ignoring those that contradict them.

**Usage and Significance**

In contemporary culture, Murphy's Law is often used as a humorous rule of thumb, offering a lighthearted perspective on the inherent unpredictability and complexity of systems. While it may not have a firm basis in scientific or academic theory, its use can serve as a reminder to always plan for potential failures and mishaps – an essential aspect of any successful project or undertaking.
