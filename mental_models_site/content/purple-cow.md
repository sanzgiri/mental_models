 Title: The Purple Cow: A Revolutionary Mental Model for Creating Remarkable Brands and Experiences

**Introduction**

The "Purple Cow" is a timeless piece of verse by American writer Gelett Burgess, serving as a powerful mental model that encapsulates the idea of being extraordinary in an otherwise ordinary world. First published in 1895, this short poem has transcended its literary roots and gained significance as a potent marketing concept emphasizing the importance of differentiation and creativity in business and beyond.

**Core Concept**

At its essence, "Purple Cow" represents the need to stand out from the crowd by creating something remarkable that captures people's attention and leaves an indelible impression. In a world saturated with mediocrity, Burgess humorously challenges us to envision a purple cow, an absurd sight that would make even the most jaded onlooker pause and wonder.

In marketing terms, Seth Godin popularized this concept in his book "Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable." Godin explains that in today's overly competitive landscape, businesses must aim to be a 'purple cow' — something so unique, valuable, or entertaining that it sparks curiosity and conversation among consumers.

**Examples**

1. **Meijer's Purple Cow Creamery**: The ice cream brand originated in 1934 when founder Fred Meijer was inspired by Burgess's poem to name his ice cream shops 'Purple Cow.' Over the years, the unique name has helped differentiate Meijer's products and create a lasting impression on customers.

2. **Williams College**: This private liberal arts college in Massachusetts adopted the purple cow as its mascot, named after the school's humor magazine Purple Cow, which, in turn, took its name from Burgess's poem. The unusual choice underscores Williams College's commitment to being different and memorable.

3. **Purple Cow Drive-In**: An ice cream stand in Crimora, Virginia, features a purple cow head on a post, serving as a local landmark that highlights the power of an attention-grabbing symbol in creating a sense of place and community.

**Application**

To apply "The Purple Cow" mental model in your daily life or decision making, consider the following:

1. **Be Remarkable**: Seek opportunities to create something distinctive that sets you apart from others. Whether it's a product, service, or idea, aim to make an impact and leave a lasting impression on those around you.

2. **Think Differently**: Embrace creativity and originality in your endeavors. Challenge the status quo and push boundaries to make your work stand out.

3. **Inspire Conversation**: Strive for ideas or creations that spark curiosity, conversation, and intrigue among others. Encourage people to share their experiences with you and your offerings with others.
