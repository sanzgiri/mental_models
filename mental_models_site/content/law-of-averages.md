# Law of Averages

 Title: Understanding the Law of Averages - Unraveling a Misconception About Probability

1. **Introduction**

   The Law of Averages, a common yet misleading concept, is often used to predict that an outcome will occur at a frequency similar to its probability over a certain period. While it might seem like a sensible observation, it frequently stems from wishful thinking or a lack of understanding about statistics. This mental model can lead individuals into falling into the gambler's fallacy, overestimating or underestimating probabilities based on past events.

2. **Core Concept**

   The Law of Averages relies on the assumption that an unnatural balance must occur in a short-term span, which is typically at odds with empirical evidence and statistical principles. In contrast, the Law of Large Numbers, a mathematical principle, states that the sample mean of a large number of randomly sampled data points will approach the population mean. The key difference between the two lies in their application—the former being a misinterpretation of probability, and the latter being a proven statistical theorem.

3. **Examples**

   - **Gambler's Fallacy**: This fallacy occurs when individuals assume that past results influence future outcomes. For example, if a roulette wheel has landed on red three consecutive times, some might believe that the next spin will result in black due to the Law of Averages. However, this notion overlooks the fact that the wheel has no memory and its probabilities do not change according to past results.

   - **Expectation Values**: This example demonstrates a belief that a sample's behavior should align with the expected value based on population statistics. For instance, if a fair coin is flipped 100 times, one might predict 50 heads and 50 tails using the Law of Averages. However, there is only an 8% chance of this outcome according to the binomial distribution.

   - **Repetition of Trials**: Applying the Law of Averages in this context suggests that performing more trials increases the probability of a rare event occurring at least once. For example, a job seeker may believe that sending their resume to enough places guarantees an interview. While it's true that conducting more trials increases the overall likelihood of success, there is no specific number of trials that guarantees the outcome.

   - **Chicago Cubs**: The song "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" references the Law of Averages in regard to the Chicago Cubs' lack of championship victories. Before winning both the National League Championship and World Series in 2016, the team had not won a title since 1945 (National League) and 1908 (World Series).

4. **Application**

   By understanding the Law of Averages, individuals can avoid making incorrect assumptions about probability, especially when dealing with random events. Instead, they should rely on statistical methods such as the Law of Large Numbers to make more accurate predictions and decisions. In daily life, this might mean avoiding assumptions based on past events and instead focusing on understanding the underlying probabilities and statistics.

5. **Related Models**

   - **Law of Large Numbers**: The Law of Averages' mathematical counterpart, which states that the average of a large number of random samples will approach the population mean.

   - **Gambler's Fallacy**: A related mental model where individuals assume past events influence future outcomes in probability games like roulette or coin flips.

   - **Regression toward the Mean**: The tendency for extreme values to regress towards the average of a distribution over time, often observed in experiments with living organisms.
