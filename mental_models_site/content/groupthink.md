# Groupthink

 **Groupthink: The Danger of Unanimity**

Groupthink is a compelling psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group, resulting in irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcomes due to the desire for harmony and conformity among its members. Coined by William H. Whyte Jr. in 1952 and further researched by psychologist Irving Janis, this mental model has far-reaching implications across various disciplines, including social psychology, communication studies, political science, management, and organizational theory.

**Core Concept**

Groupthink arises when a group's cohesiveness leads to a diminished critical evaluation of alternative courses of action. Members within such groups tend to suppress controversial ideas or alternative solutions, leading to the loss of individual creativity and independent thinking. Group dynamics create an "illusion of invulnerability," resulting in overconfidence in decision-making abilities and underestimation of opponents. Peer pressure often prevents individuals from speaking out against the consensus, as fear of rocking the boat or being perceived negatively by the group prevails.

**Examples**

1. **The Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961)**: This failed invasion of Cuba, led by a cohesive and highly-ranked U.S. military group, is one of Janis' prime case studies for groupthink. The decision was made in the face of dissenting intelligence reports and advice from experts, ultimately leading to disaster.

2. **Pearl Harbor Attack (1941)**: This infamous event demonstrated the destructive power of groupthink. Despite mounting evidence of a potential Japanese attack, U.S. leaders were unable or unwilling to consider alternative courses of action, resulting in catastrophic consequences.

3. **Nazi Germany's Invasion of the Soviet Union (1941)**: Adolf Hitler and his inner circle's decision to invade the Soviet Union is another example of groupthink, as they overestimated their power and underestimated the risks, leading to the eventual downfall of the Nazi regime.

**Application**

Understanding groupthink can help individuals make more informed decisions by recognizing its symptoms and taking steps to counteract it. To avoid groupthink, seek diverse perspectives within decision-making groups, encourage open dialogue, and actively solicit alternative viewpoints. Additionally, questioning the status quo and considering multiple options before reaching a consensus can foster critical thinking and help prevent irrational decisions.

**Related Models**

1. **Confirmation Bias**: A related mental model in which individuals tend to favor information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or values over conflicting information.

2. **Herd Mentality**: This psychological phenomenon is characterized by individuals following the actions of a group, often without critical analysis or independent thought.

3. **Authority Bias**: A tendency to defer to authority figures and trust their judgement, even when faced with contradictory evidence.

By understanding these related mental models, individuals can better recognize and address irrational decision-making tendencies within themselves and others.
