# Regression to the Mean

 **Regression to the Mean: A Crucial Mental Model in Statistics and Life**

Regression to the Mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that suggests if an observation or sample is extreme, the next sampling of the same random variable will likely be closer to its mean. This mental model, first popularized by Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century, is crucial in understanding various aspects of life and decision-making.

**Core Concept**

At its heart, RTM is about the natural tendency for extreme results to moderate over time due to the influence of random factors. If a set of observations follows a normal distribution, extreme values are more likely due to random fluctuations rather than inherent characteristics. When you select these extreme values and measure them again, these random fluctuations are less likely to produce such extreme results, causing the mean to regress towards the overall population mean.

**Examples**

1. **Student Test Scores**: In a class of students taking a test, some will score significantly above or below the average due to luck (good or bad guesses). If you select only the top scorers and give them another test, their scores are expected to regress towards the mean because luck is less likely to repeat itself.

2. **Sports Performance**: If your favorite sports team won the championship last year, it doesn't guarantee they will win next season. To the extent that their success was due to skill (good condition, top coach), they are more likely to win again. However, if their performance was largely due to luck (favorable draws, exceptional draft picks), their chances of repeating the victory diminish.

3. **Business Profitability**: If a business has a highly profitable quarter, it's likely to perform less well in the following quarter, even if the underlying factors remain unchanged. This regression towards the mean can be seen as the "sophomore slump" in baseball players or the infamous "Sports Illustrated cover jinx."

**Application**

Understanding RTM helps you make more informed decisions and avoid misinterpretations of data. In conducting experiments, it's essential to account for this phenomenon when analyzing extreme results. For instance, if a treatment is effective, the treated group should show more improvement than a control group over time. In your daily life, beware of jumping to conclusions based on isolated extreme events; these may be due to randomness rather than a lasting trend.

**Related Models**

1. **Normal Distribution**: Understanding RTM requires familiarity with the normal distribution, a bell-shaped curve that describes the probability of obtaining different results in a large number of independent trials.

2. **Gambler's Fallacy**: This cognitive bias is related to RTM as it involves the incorrect belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a certain period, it will happen less frequently in the future to "make up" for it.

3. **Selection Bias**: In statistics, this occurs when data is selectively sampled to favor one outcome over others, leading to skewed results. RTM can help identify and correct for selection bias by recognizing and accounting for extreme values that may be influenced by random factors rather than the phenomenon being studied.
