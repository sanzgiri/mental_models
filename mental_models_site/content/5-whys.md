# 5 Whys

 **Introduction**

The mental model known as "5 Whys" is an innovative problem-solving technique that delves into the intricate cause-and-effect relationships underlying a specific issue. Developed by Taiichi Ohno at Toyota Motor Corporation, this method aims to uncover the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking the question "why?" This model has gained immense popularity in various industries due to its simplicity and effectiveness in streamlining problem-solving processes.

**Core Concept**

At its core, the 5 Whys technique involves iterative interrogation to trace a chain of causality from an observed effect back to the root cause. The user systematically asks "why" five times, each question focusing on the previous answer until a fundamental issue is identified that directly connects to the initial problem. While the number of questions can vary depending on the complexity of the issue, five iterations are commonly considered sufficient.

**Examples**

1. Business: In a manufacturing setting, bolts may be cross-threaded in an engine block production line. By repeatedly asking "why," the root cause can be traced to a broken shelf foot that caused the bin's contents to fall and roll under shelves (as per the example provided). This identification enables immediate action to prevent reoccurrences, like replacing the faulty shelf foot.

2. Life: Suppose you consistently fail to meet deadlines despite having ample time to complete tasks. By employing the 5 Whys technique, one might uncover that procrastination is the root cause (Why? I didn't start on time. Why? I had a lack of motivation. Why? I was overwhelmed by the task. Why? I struggled with prioritizing tasks effectively. Why? I didn't have a clear plan or system for organizing tasks).

3. History: In Plato's "Meno," Socrates uses repeated questioning to guide Meno through an intellectual journey, ultimately leading him to a new understanding of virtue (Why do you think virtue is taught rather than discovered? Why do you believe it can be taught? Why should we suppose that knowledge about virtue exists in the soul before it's ever acquired by learning? etc.).

**Application**

The 5 Whys technique can be applied in various contexts to simplify complex problems and foster effective decision-making. By adopting this mental model, individuals and organizations can uncover hidden issues, eliminate assumptions, and focus on long-term solutions instead of temporary fixes.
