# Contact Theory

 **Introduction**

Contact Theory, a mental model rooted in psychology and social sciences, suggests that intergroup contact under appropriate conditions can effectively reduce prejudice between majority and minority group members. This theory gained traction post World War II, as policymakers and researchers sought solutions to address the policy implications of interracial contact. The work of social psychologist Gordon Allport, who outlined the most widely cited form of this hypothesis in his 1954 book "The Nature of Prejudice," remains foundational to the understanding of Contact Theory ([Contact Theory](/models/contact-theory)).

**Core Concept**

Allport's contact hypothesis posits that under four specific conditions, intergroup contact can help reduce prejudice: equal status, common goals, intergroup cooperation, and support from authorities or customs. Equal status implies that both groups must engage equally in the relationship, with similar backgrounds, qualities, and characteristics. Common goals involve both groups working together on a problem or task, while intergroup cooperation refers to collaboration without competition ([Group Dynamics](/models/group-dynamics)). Support from authorities or customs reinforces friendly, helpful, egalitarian attitudes and discourages ingroup-outgroup comparisons.

**Examples**

1. Prejudice towards African Americans: Studies have shown that white athletes who play team sports (e.g., football or basketball) report less prejudice than those who play individual sports (e.g., track or swimming), as team sports require cooperation and collaborative interactions to succeed ([Prejudice Reduction](/models/prejudice-reduction)).
2. Prejudice towards LGBTQ+ individuals: Research demonstrates that college students who have pleasant interactions with homosexuals tend to accept them as a group, and increased contact predicts more favorable attitudes towards gay men ([LGBTQ+ Rights](/models/lgbtq-rights)).
3. Prejudice towards Muslims in Europe: Studies indicate that living in regions with high numbers of Muslims or having Muslim colleagues reduces anti-Muslim attitudes, while teaching in schools with a larger share of Muslim students may lead to more negative attitudes ([Islamophobia](/models/islamophobia)).

**Application**

In daily life and decision making, individuals can apply Contact Theory by seeking opportunities for equal status contact, common goals, and intergroup cooperation. Encouraging such interactions can help bridge divides between groups and promote understanding, empathy, and reduced prejudice.
