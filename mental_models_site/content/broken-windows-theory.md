 **The Broken Windows Theory: A Mental Model of Urban Crime Prevention**

The Broken Windows Theory is a criminological concept that posits visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior, and civil disorder can create an environment conducive to further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. This theory was first introduced in 1982 by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling and gained popularity in the 1990s through New York City police commissioner William Bratton's policing policies.

**Core Concept**

The Broken Windows Theory suggests that maintaining order, even in minor matters such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, and fare evasion, helps create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness. The theory argues that a disordered environment sends signals to criminals that the area is not monitored and that criminal behavior has little risk of detection. Conversely, an ordered and clean environment indicates that the area is monitored and that criminal behavior is not tolerated.

**Examples**

1. **New York City in the 1980s and 1990s**: The theory was popularized during William Bratton's tenure as NYC police commissioner, where strategies based on the Broken Windows Theory led to significant reductions in crime rates.
2. **Germantown, Philadelphia**: In the 1990s, a community clean-up initiative implemented the Broken Windows Theory, leading to reduced crime and improved quality of life.
3. **Business Operations**: The principle can also be applied to businesses, where maintaining order and cleanliness (e.g., fixing broken windows promptly, enforcing no loitering policies) can deter petty crimes and create a more welcoming environment for customers.

**Application**

In daily life, the Broken Windows Theory encourages individuals to take responsibility for their surroundings by reporting and addressing minor issues of disorder. This proactive approach can contribute to the creation of safer, cleaner communities. In decision-making, considering the potential impact of seemingly insignificant problems can help prevent their escalation into larger issues.

**Related Models**

1. [Defensible Space Theory](/models/defensible-space-theory) - This model, proposed by Oscar Newman, emphasizes that people in the community help with crime prevention and that an area is safer if the people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility towards it.
2. [Zero Tolerance Policing](/models/zero-tolerance-policing) - While sometimes confused with Broken Windows Theory, Zero Tolerance Policing involves strict enforcement of all laws, regardless of their severity, to deter criminal behavior.
