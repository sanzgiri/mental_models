# Bystander Effect

 **Introduction**

The Bystander Effect is a fascinating and crucial mental model that delves into human behavior during emergencies or crisis situations. It posits that individuals are less likely to offer help when there are other people present, as opposed to when they are alone. This theory, first proposed in 1964 after the murder of Kitty Genovese, has significant implications for our understanding of social dynamics and moral responsibility.

**Core Concept**

The Bystander Effect is rooted in five characteristics of emergencies: they involve harm or potential harm, are unusual and rare, require immediate action, cannot be predicted or expected, and the required action varies from situation to situation. When faced with an emergency, individuals go through cognitive and behavioral processes. They first notice if something is amiss, interpret the situation as an emergency, gauge their degree of responsibility, consider the form of assistance, and finally implement the chosen action.

In a classic experiment by Darley and Latané, students were placed in a room either alone or with others to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return. When smoke was pumped into the room to simulate an emergency, students working alone noticed it immediately, whereas those in groups took longer. This delay is often due to social norms and the fear of appearing rude or nosy.

**Examples**

1. **The Kitty Genovese Murder (1964)**: This tragic event sparked interest in the Bystander Effect when it was incorrectly reported that 37 witnesses did nothing as Kitty Genovese was murdered over an hour. While the exact number of witnesses is disputed, the incident highlighted the potential for inaction during emergencies.

2. **The London Tube Pusher (2004)**: In this real-life scenario, a man fell onto the tracks at King's Cross St. Pancras tube station. Despite the crowd of people who could have helped him, no one provided immediate assistance. It wasn't until the train operator noticed and stopped the train that the man was rescued.

3. **The Stanford Prison Experiment (1971)**: This psychological study demonstrated how people can easily conform to expected roles and abdicate personal responsibility, even in seemingly benign situations like a simulated prison.
