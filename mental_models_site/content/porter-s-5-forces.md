# Porter's 5 Forces

 **Introduction**

Porter's Five Forces is a strategic analysis tool that helps businesses evaluate the competitive intensity and profitability of an industry by identifying five key forces that shape competition. Developed by Michael E. Porter of Harvard Business School, this model is essential for understanding the competitive landscape and making informed business decisions.

**Core Concept**

The Five Forces framework consists of three sources of "horizontal competition" and two sources of "vertical competition." Horizontal competition includes the threat of substitute products or services, the threat posed by established industry rivals, and the threat of new entrants. Vertical competition encompasses the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of buyers. The competitive intensity in an industry is influenced by these forces, and a higher competitive intensity often results in lower profitability.

**Threat of New Entrants:** High barriers to entry make it difficult for new competitors to enter an industry, while low barriers encourage new entrants. Barriers can include economies of scale, network effects, customer switching costs, capital requirements, incumbency advantages, government policy, and expected retaliation from existing companies.

**Threat of Substitutes:** The threat of substitute products or services puts pressure on existing businesses by offering alternative solutions to the same economic need. Factors that affect the level of threat include buyer propensity to substitute, relative price performance, buyer switching costs, perceived level of product differentiation, number of substitutes available, ease of substitution, and availability of close substitutes.

**Competitive Rivalry:** The intensity of competition among existing firms is a significant determinant of industry profitability. Factors that influence competitive rivalry include competitive advantage through innovation, competition between online and offline organizations, level of advertising expense, powerful competitive strategy, and firm concentration ratio.

**Bargaining Power of Buyers:** The bargaining power of buyers depends on factors such as buyer concentration to firm concentration ratio, degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution, bargaining leverage, buyer switching costs, buyer information availability, availability of existing substitute products, buyer price sensitivity, differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products, and RFM (customer value) analysis.

**Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers is influenced by supplier switching costs relative to firm switching costs, degree of differentiation of inputs, impact of inputs on cost and differentiation, presence of substitute inputs, strength of the distribution channel, supplier concentration to the firm concentration ratio, employee solidarity (e.g., labor unions), and supplier competition.

**Examples**

1. **Airlines Industry:** The airline industry is characterized by high fixed costs, low variable costs, and intense competitive rivalry. Barriers to entry are relatively low due to the widespread availability of aircraft and pilot training programs. As a result, many airlines compete fiercely on factors such as pricing, route networks, and service quality.

2. **Smartphone Industry:** In the smartphone market, Apple and Samsung dominate with high bargaining power due to their unique products and strong brand recognition. The threat of substitute products is minimal because users have become dependent on the ecosystems provided by these companies (e.g., apps, services). However, new entrants continue to face barriers due to high capital requirements and the need for significant investment in research and development.

3. **Fast-Food Industry:** Fast food chains like McDonald's and Subway have a strong competitive advantage through innovation and brand recognition. However, the bargaining power of suppliers (e.g., farmers, distributors) can be substantial due to their concentration and the necessity of specific ingredients for certain menu items.
