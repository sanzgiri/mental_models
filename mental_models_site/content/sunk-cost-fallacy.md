# Sunk-Cost Fallacy

 **Title: The Sunk-Cost Fallacy: A Mental Model of Irrational Decision Making**

The mental model known as the Sunk-Cost Fallacy is a powerful concept that sheds light on one of the most common errors humans make when making decisions. This fallacy, rooted in economics and business decision-making, occurs when individuals continue to invest resources into a venture due to previously invested, non-recoverable costs, disregarding their irrelevance to future rational decision-making.

**Core Concept**

According to classical economics, only prospective (future) costs are relevant for making rational decisions. Past mistakes or investments, known as sunk costs, should have no influence on future decisions because they cannot be recovered. This principle is known as the Bygones Principle or Marginal Principle. In other words, decision-makers should focus solely on future consequences and not be swayed by past expenditures (Bygones principle, 2021).

**Examples**

1. **Business Decisions:** Companies may continue to invest in projects even if their value has drastically decreased due to sunk costs. For example, the British and French governments continued funding the development of the Concorde supersonic airplane despite its lack of economic viability (Concorde fallacy).
2. **Personal Relationships:** People often stay in failing relationships because they feel they have invested too much time and effort to leave. This is an example of the sunk cost effect causing individuals to remain committed to a failing endeavor, rather than making rational decisions that prioritize future happiness (Rego et al., 2014).
3. **Historical Projects:** In some cases, governments have continued funding for projects such as nuclear power plants even after it became economically unviable due to previous investments (De Bondt & Makhija, 1988).

**Application**

To apply the Sunk-Cost Fallacy in your daily life, you should evaluate decisions based on their future consequences and avoid being swayed by past investments. This can help you make more rational, efficient, and profitable choices that focus on maximizing your long-term success.

**Related Models**

1. **Planning Fallacy:** A related mental model where individuals underestimate the time, cost, and risk involved in future projects, often leading to overoptimism (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
2. **Confirmation Bias:** The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and remember information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs, which can contribute to the Sunk-Cost Fallacy by reinforcing the idea that previous investments should influence future decisions (Nickerson, 1998).
3. **Cognitive Dissonance:** The mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values at the same time, which can lead to changes in behavior or justifications to reduce the dissonance and maintain consistency (Festinger, 1957).

In conclusion, understanding the Sunk-Cost Fallacy is essential for making rational decisions that prioritize long-term success over past investments. By recognizing this fallacy and avoiding its pitfalls, individuals can improve their decision-making abilities and enhance their overall well-being.
