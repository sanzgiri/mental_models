# Lateral Thinking

 **Introduction**

Lateral thinking is a creative problem-solving approach that involves generating novel and indirect solutions to problems by shifting away from traditional step-by-step logic. This mental model, coined by Maltese psychologist Edward de Bono in 1967, emphasizes the importance of thinking outside the box and considering unconventional ideas. Lateral thinking can lead to significant breakthroughs, as it challenges established patterns and encourages the exploration of new perspectives.

**Core Concept**

Lateral thinking deliberately distances itself from vertical thinking, the traditional method for problem-solving that follows a linear, logical sequence. Instead, lateral thinking focuses on the "movement value" of statements and ideas, enabling one to move from one known idea to new ones. Edward de Bono outlined four types of thinking tools: idea-generating tools, focus tools, harvest tools, and treatment tools. These tools help break current thinking patterns, broaden where to search for new ideas, ensure more value is received from the output, and promote consideration of real-world constraints.

**Examples**

1. **The Nine Dots Puzzle**: One of de Bono's examples is the Nine Dots Puzzle, which consists of a grid with nine dots arranged in a 3x3 pattern. Traditional vertical thinking would lead one to believe that a solution must be found within the lines, but lateral thinking encourages drawing lines outside the box to connect all the dots, leading to an innovative solution.
2. **Provocation and the Factory Downstream**: Another example is the provocation technique, where a factory was set up "downstream of itself," forcing it to take its water input from a point downstream of its output. This outlandish idea later became law in some countries, demonstrating how lateral thinking can lead to groundbreaking solutions.
3. **Challenging Coffee Cups**: The challenge technique highlights the question "Why?" to challenge existing norms and generate new ideas. For example, challenging the handles on coffee cups led to potential solutions such as insulated finger grips, separate coffee cup holders, or reducing the temperature of coffee itself.

**Application**

Applying lateral thinking in daily life can lead to improved creativity, problem-solving skills, and adaptability. To incorporate this mental model into your decision-making process, try using de Bono's thinking tools like random entry idea generation, provocation idea generation, movement techniques, challenge, concept formation, disproving, fractionation, and problem solving. Embrace unconventional ideas and be open to thinking outside the box to find innovative solutions.
