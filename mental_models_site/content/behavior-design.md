# Behavior Design

 **Introduction**

Behavior Design is a sub-category of design that focuses on shaping and influencing human behavior. It acknowledges the significant impact that artifacts have on human behavior and decision-making, particularly in areas such as health, wellbeing, sustainability, safety, crime prevention, and social context. Understanding Behavior Design is crucial because it offers a means to create change intentionally, whether desirable or undesirable, and encourages ethical behavior and goals.

**Core Concept**

Behavior Design draws upon theories of behavioral change, including personal, behavioral, and environmental characteristics as drivers for behavior change. It employs various strategies such as emotion design, persuasive technology, and design psychology to influence human behavior. The process involves identifying target behaviors, understanding the factors that influence these behaviors, and designing interventions to alter them.

**Examples**

1. Health and Wellbeing: Fitness trackers like Fitbit or Apple Watch use persuasive technology to encourage physical activity by providing feedback on a user's daily steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns.
2. Sustainability: The One Less plastic bottle campaign in London used environmental design to promote the use of reusable water bottles. By installing water refill stations throughout the city and designing eye-catching graphics for the bottles, they were able to reduce single-use plastic bottle consumption significantly.
3. Crime Prevention: Broken Windows Theory, proposed by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, posits that maintaining and improving urban environments can help deter criminal behavior. By addressing minor issues like graffiti, litter, and broken windows, neighborhoods can create a sense of order and safety that discourages crime.

**Application**

Readers can apply Behavior Design in their daily lives by understanding the factors that influence their own behaviors and making intentional choices to change them. For example, if someone wants to exercise more, they could use a fitness tracker to monitor their progress, set achievable goals, and create a supportive environment (e.g., preparing workout clothes the night before). In decision-making, considering the potential behavioral impacts of design can help create solutions that promote positive change.
