# System 2 (Slow)

 **Introduction**

The mental model "System 2 (Slow)" is a concept derived from Alan Turing's groundbreaking PhD dissertation, "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals," which introduced the theory of ordinal logic. This model offers an intriguing exploration into formal mathematical systems in light of Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems, providing a deep understanding of the limitations and potential solutions to logical inconsistencies within these systems. Understanding System 2 can offer valuable insights into decision-making processes, problem-solving strategies, and the nature of knowledge itself.

**Core Concept**

At its core, System 2 (Slow) is a model that builds upon Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems to address the inherent limitations of formal systems. Specifically, it proposes an iterative process whereby new axioms are continually added to a system in response to unprovable true statements (known as Godel numbers), creating a series of increasingly complex theories – Gα, one for each ordinal number α. This process effectively "goes beyond infinity," expanding the scope of what can be proved within a given formal system.

Turing's thesis does not propose a new type of formal logic or ranked logic systems but instead investigates the possibility of resolving the Gödelian incompleteness condition using Cantor's method of infinites. By employing transfinite recursion, System 2 seeks to construct a comprehensive and consistent logical framework that can accommodate unprovable truths.

**Examples**

1. **Mathematical Proof**: In mathematics, the iterative process outlined by System 2 (Slow) allows for the construction of increasingly more powerful mathematical systems capable of proving previously unprovable statements. For instance, a formal system S might be unable to prove a certain theorem G, but by adding a new axiom to create S', additional proofs can be discovered within the expanded system.

2. **Artificial Intelligence**: In theoretical computer science, Turing's use of computing oracles has had a profound impact on the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The concept of System 2 (Slow) lends itself to the design of AI systems that can handle complex, unpredictable scenarios by continually refining their knowledge base through feedback and learning from experience.

3. **Ethical Decision-Making**: In daily life, understanding System 2 (Slow) can help individuals make more informed ethical decisions. By acknowledging the limitations of our own decision-making processes and recognizing that there may always be unprovable truths or unforeseen consequences, we can approach complex moral dilemmas with a more open and thoughtful mindset, considering multiple perspectives and refining our beliefs through ongoing reflection and learning.

**Application**

Applying System 2 (Slow) in daily life involves recognizing and embracing the complexity of decision-making processes. Instead of seeking simple, absolute answers to complex problems, one should strive for a more nuanced understanding by considering multiple perspectives, acknowledging unprovable truths, and being open to ongoing learning and refinement. By emulating the iterative process outlined in System 2 (Slow), we can develop a more comprehensive and consistent approach to solving problems and making decisions.

**Related Models**

1. **System 1 (Fast)**: A counterpoint to System 2 (Slow), this mental model refers to the intuitive, automatic thought processes that occur quickly and without conscious effort. System 1 is crucial for efficient decision-making but can also lead to biases and errors when confronted with complex or ambiguous situations.

2. **Cognitive Dissonance**: This psychological concept describes the mental discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time. Understanding System 2 (Slow) can help individuals recognize and address cognitive dissonance by acknowledging the complexity of their beliefs and being open to change in light of new information or unprovable truths.

3. **The Precautionary Principle**: This is a philosophical approach that emphasizes taking preventive measures to protect the public from potential harm, even if some scientific uncertainty exists regarding the risk. System 2 (Slow) can help individuals navigate situations involving the precautionary principle by encouraging a thoughtful and iterative approach to decision-making, considering multiple perspectives and learning from past experiences in order to minimize potential risks.
