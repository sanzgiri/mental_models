 **The Power of First Impressions: Understanding Anchoring Bias**

The mental model known as Anchoring Bias is a psychological phenomenon that significantly influences individuals' judgments and decisions, often swaying them towards an initial reference point or "anchor" that may be completely irrelevant. This powerful cognitive bias was first identified in psychophysics and later formalized by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the field of behavioral economics.

**Core Concept**

Anchoring Bias operates on the principle of mental shortcuts, or heuristics, that individuals use to make estimates under uncertainty. When faced with a range of possibilities, people often rely on an initial value (the anchor) as a reference point and adjust their subsequent judgments accordingly. This adjustment may not necessarily reflect the true value, resulting in biased estimations.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: In a study by Dan Ariely, participants were found to bid higher for items based on the last two digits of their social security numbers. The number that served as an anchor influenced their perceived value of the items, demonstrating the impact of anchoring bias in consumer behavior. [Confirmation Bias](/models/confirmation-bias) and [Framing Effects](/models/framing-effects) are related mental models that further explain how people's judgments can be swayed by context and initial impressions.

2. **History**: The anchoring bias played a significant role during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when US Secretary of State Dean Rusk used the number 80 as an anchor while discussing the number of Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba. This initial value influenced subsequent negotiations and contributed to the resolution of the crisis. [Cognitive Dissonance](/models/cognitive-dissonance) and [Sunk Cost Fallacy](/models/sunk-cost-fallacy) are other mental models that shed light on decision-making during this historical event.

3. **Life**: In a real estate market study, it was discovered that the 2-year and 9-year highs on the Case-Shiller House Price Index could be used as anchors in predicting current house prices. This demonstrates how past experiences or reference points can influence future expectations. [Availability Heuristic](/models/availability-heuristic) is a related mental model that explains how people often rely on readily available information when making judgments.

**Application**

To avoid the anchoring bias in your daily life, it's essential to be aware of potential anchors and consciously adjust your estimations accordingly. Whenever you face a decision, take time to consider multiple perspectives and gather diverse information before reaching a conclusion. [Cognitive Reframing](/models/cognitive-reframing) can also help you challenge initial impressions and avoid being influenced by irrelevant anchors.
