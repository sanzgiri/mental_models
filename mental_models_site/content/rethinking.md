# Rethinking

 **Introduction**

Rethinking, a process of reviewing and potentially altering decisions made earlier, is an essential mental model that underpins critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability in both personal and professional contexts. It serves as the backbone for reevaluating established ideas, challenging conventional wisdom, and fostering innovation by encouraging individuals to scrutinize their initial judgments or conclusions more thoroughly.

**Core Concept**

At its core, rethinking is about acknowledging that human decision-making is not always perfect and that we often lack complete information when making decisions. Rethinking allows us to reassess our past choices, taking into account new insights, circumstances, or perspectives that may have emerged since the initial decision was made. The process of rethinking involves evaluating the soundness of our previous reasoning, questioning assumptions, and searching for alternative solutions.

**Examples**

1. **Academia**: Rethinking Marxism is a journal founded in 1998 by scholars at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The publication serves as an influential platform for Althusserian Marxism in North America, encouraging reevaluation and refinement of established theories to better fit contemporary contexts ([Rethinking Marxism](/models/rethinking-marxism)).
2. **Social Efforts**: Rethink Afghanistan is a 2009 documentary by Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films that questioned the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan following the September 11 terrorist attacks, advocating for a reassessment of American foreign policy in the region ([Rethink Afghanistan](/models/rethink-afghanistan)).
3. **Mental Health**: Paris Williams' 2012 book Rethinking Madness explores creative approaches to dealing with mental illness, challenging traditional perceptions and treatment methods in favor of more humane and effective solutions ([Rethinking Madness](/models/rethinking-madness)).

**Application**

To apply the mental model of rethinking in your daily life, adopt a mindset that encourages continual reassessment of your decisions and beliefs. Whenever you encounter new information or perspectives, take a moment to consider how they might alter your previous judgments. Be open to change and willing to adapt your views accordingly.

**Related Models**

1. [Inversion](/models/inversion): Inversion is the mental model of flipping assumptions to generate unconventional solutions, which can complement rethinking by encouraging exploration of alternative perspectives during the reassessment process.
2. [First Principles Thinking](/models/first-principles-thinking): First principles thinking involves breaking down complex ideas into their fundamental truths, allowing for a more critical evaluation and potential rethinking of established beliefs.
