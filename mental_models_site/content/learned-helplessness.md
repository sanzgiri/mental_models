# Learned Helplessness

 **Introduction**

Learned helplessness is a psychological concept that describes the behavior exhibited by an individual or animal when they perceive themselves as unable to control or influence their circumstances, even when given the opportunity to do so. This mental model is significant as it provides insight into the development of depression and other mental illnesses, highlighting the crucial role of perceived control in maintaining mental health.

**Core Concept**

The theory of learned helplessness was initially proposed by Martin Seligman in 1967, based on experiments with dogs. The research showed that when dogs were exposed to repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control, they eventually stopped trying to escape or avoid the stimuli, even when given clear opportunities to do so. This behavior was labeled as 'learned helplessness'. Over the years, neuroscience has provided further insight into this phenomenon, revealing that the brain's default state is to assume control is not present. Prolonged exposure to aversive stimuli results in the unlearning of control.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: Employees who are consistently exposed to decisions made by their superiors without any input or authority, may develop learned helplessness, leading to decreased motivation and productivity.

2. **History**: During the Holocaust, victims often felt powerless to escape their circumstances, leading to feelings of despair and hopelessness that contributed to the high mortality rates among prisoners in concentration camps.

3. **Life**: A student who consistently performs poorly in school, despite putting forth effort, may develop learned helplessness, resulting in decreased motivation and academic achievement.

**Application**

Recognizing signs of learned helplessness in oneself or others can help to address the root cause of feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness. Encouraging self-efficacy, setting achievable goals, and creating opportunities for autonomy and control can be effective strategies for combating learned helplessness.
