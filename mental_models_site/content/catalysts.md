# Catalysts

 **Introduction**

The mental model of Catalysts is a fundamental concept in chemistry that refers to substances which increase the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed during the process. These substances, known as catalysts, remain unchanged after the reaction and play a crucial role in various industries and natural processes. Understanding this mental model can provide valuable insights for decision-making and problem-solving in various fields.

**Core Concept**

Catalysis occurs due to an alternative mechanism offered by the catalyst, which may be much faster than the noncatalyzed mechanism. The catalyst allows reactions to occur by providing intermediates that lead to the final reaction product, while regenerating itself in the process. This mechanism results in a significant increase in the reaction rate, as fewer molecular collisions need to have sufficient energy to overcome the activation energy barrier. Catalysis can be classified as homogeneous (when both catalyst and reactants are in the same phase) or heterogeneous (when they are in different phases).

**Homogeneous Catalysis**

In homogeneous catalysis, the catalyst is dissolved in the same medium as the reactants. Examples of such catalysts include transition metal salts that catalyze the oxidation of p-xylene to terephthalic acid and organometallic complexes used in high-volume processes like hydroformylation, hydrosilylation, and hydrocyanation.

**Heterogeneous Catalysis**

In heterogeneous catalysis, the catalyst is a solid or immiscible liquid that acts on substrates in a liquid or gaseous reaction mixture. Important examples include iron-based catalysts used for ammonia synthesis and vanadium(V) oxide for the production of sulfuric acid. These catalysts often have active sites, which are atoms or crystal faces where the substrate binds, and may be supported on other materials to enhance effectiveness or minimize cost.

**Organocatalysis**

While transition metals often receive significant attention in catalysis studies, small organic molecules without metals can also exhibit catalytic properties. Organocatalysts are typically non-metal compounds that use noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding to facilitate reactions. These organocatalysts have gained popularity due to their competitive nature compared to traditional metal(-ion)-containing catalysts, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where they are used for asymmetric synthesis.
