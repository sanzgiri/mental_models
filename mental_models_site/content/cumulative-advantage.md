# Cumulative Advantage

 Title: Cumulative Advantage: The Power Law of Success and Wealth Distribution

Introduction:
Cumulative Advantage, also known as Preferential Attachment or the Matthew Effect, is a mental model that explains how certain entities, such as individuals, ideas, or objects, tend to grow faster as they accumulate more resources or recognition. This phenomenon, often described as "the rich get richer," is essential to understanding the emergence of power law distributions and unequal outcomes in various fields.

Core Concept:
The core idea behind Cumulative Advantage is that resources are distributed disproportionately based on existing amounts. In a system where new entities (like species, cities, or ideas) are added continuously, each entity has a higher chance of gaining additional resources (balls in the Wikipedia example) proportionate to its current resource count. This process leads to an uneven distribution of resources over time, resulting in power law distributions with a long tail of relatively few entities holding most of the resources.

Examples:
1. **Business Success**: Venture capital investments often follow Cumulative Advantage principles. Startups that secure initial funding are more likely to receive subsequent funding due to their demonstrated success, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where successful startups continue to attract investment while less successful ones struggle to gain traction.
2. **Social Networks**: Popular social media personalities or platforms tend to gain followers and engagement at an accelerated rate compared to newcomers. As they grow their audience, they can leverage that larger base for even more growth – a classic example of cumulative advantage in action.
3. **Historical Scientific Discoveries**: In the scientific community, famous scientists are often credited with discoveries or breakthroughs made by less well-known researchers. This phenomenon, known as the Matthew Effect, highlights how recognition and credit can accumulate over time, further boosting an individual's reputation and influence.

Application:
Understanding Cumulative Advantage can help individuals make more informed decisions about where to invest their time, energy, or resources. By recognizing that successful entities often experience a self-reinforcing cycle of growth, people can be better positioned to identify emerging trends, opportunities, or risks. This awareness may lead to strategic decision-making and proactive action in personal or professional pursuits.

Related Models:
1. [Gibrat's Law](/models/gibrats-law): Gibrat's law states that the distribution of growth rates for similar entities (e.g., companies) is random, regardless of their size. While seemingly contradictory to Cumulative Advantage, these models describe different aspects of entity growth and can coexist in certain systems.
2. [The Power Law](/models/power-law): The Power Law describes the distribution of various phenomena exhibiting a long tail, with relatively few entities holding most of the resources or influence. Cumulative Advantage is one possible mechanism for generating power law distributions.
