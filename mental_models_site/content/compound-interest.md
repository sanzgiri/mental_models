# Compound Interest

 **Introduction**

Compound Interest is a financial concept that highlights the growth of an investment or debt over time due to periodic re-investment of interest, earnings, or other periods' accumulated value. This mental model holds significant importance as it can significantly impact one's wealth creation and debt management over extended periods.

**Core Concept**

Compounding frequency is the number of times per a given unit of time (usually years) that interest is calculated on the principal amount plus any previously accumulated interest. The compounded interest depends on the simple annual interest rate and the frequency at which it's compounded. For instance, if interest is calculated monthly, the compounding frequency would be 12 times per year.

The total accumulated value after t years can be calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the initial principal sum, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of compounding periods per year, and t is the time in years.

**Examples**

1. Corporate bonds and government bonds often offer interest payable semi-annually (twice a year). The amount paid every six months is half the disclosed interest rate multiplied by the principal. The yearly compounded rate is higher than the disclosed rate.
2. Home mortgages often have amortized payments, meaning that the loan balance decreases over time with each monthly payment, and the interest portion gradually reduces as the loan balance decreases.
3. In a savings account offering 4% annual interest rate compounded quarterly (4 times a year), an initial deposit of $1,000 will grow to approximately $1,041 after one year, assuming no additional deposits or withdrawals.
