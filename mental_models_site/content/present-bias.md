 Title: Present Bias: The Psychological Tendency that Shapes Our Decisions and Actions

In the realm of behavioral economics, a fundamental mental model that significantly impacts our decisions and actions is the Present Bias. This model describes the tendency to favor immediate rewards over larger future rewards, a trait that arises from an overvaluation of present gratification compared to long-term consequences (Wikipedia, 2021).

**Core Concept**

The Present Bias originates from our brain's wiring, particularly the activation of emotion- and reward-processing areas in response to immediate rewards. This bias is mediated by distinct brain systems: the medial prefrontal cortex, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, and others (Wikipedia, 2021). These areas become more active in response to immediate rewards than future ones, even when the latter are larger.

**Examples**

1. **Childhood Development**: The famous Stanford Marshmallow Experiment of the 1970s is a prime example of Present Bias in action. Children were given the choice between eating one marshmallow immediately or waiting for another, larger reward. Those who opted for immediate gratification showed less self-control and lower academic performance later in life (Wikipedia, 2021).

2. **Political Participation**: Present Bias also influences political decisions. Voting requires an immediate effort but the benefits often materialize in the future. People who exhibit more patience with regard to future political changes are more likely to participate in elections (Wikipedia, 2021).

3. **Healthcare Decisions**: Present Bias affects individual health care decision-making, leading people to prioritize short-term benefits over long-term consequences. For instance, procrastination in seeking medical help or adhering to health care guidelines can have severe long-term effects (Wikipedia, 2021).

**Application**

Understanding Present Bias can help individuals make more informed decisions by considering both immediate and future rewards. Cultivating self-control and foresight can help counteract this bias and promote better life outcomes. For example, setting goals, creating a savings plan, or establishing healthy habits can help combat the urge for instant gratification (Wikipedia, 2021).

**Related Models**

1. **Hyperbolic Discounting**: Present Bias is closely related to Hyperbolic Discounting, which also describes a preference for immediate rewards but differs in time consistency (Wikipedia, 2021).

2. **Procrastination**: Procrastination is another mental model that arises from Present Bias, as it often results from delaying tasks with immediate costs in favor of tasks with immediate rewards (Wikipedia, 2021).

**Conclusion**

Present Bias, the tendency to favor immediate rewards over larger future ones, significantly shapes our decisions and actions. Understanding this mental model can help individuals make more informed choices and cultivate self-control for better life outcomes. By being aware of Present Bias, we can strive to balance immediate gratification with long-term benefits.
