# Hedonic Adaptation

 **Hedonic Adaptation: The Treadmill of Happiness**

Hedonic adaptation, also known as the hedonic treadmill, is a fascinating mental model that suggests humans quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness (or sadness) despite major positive or negative events or life changes. This theory, first coined by Brickman and Campbell in 1971, has profound implications for our understanding of human happiness and how it affects our lives.

**Core Concept**

The mechanism behind hedonic adaptation is rooted in the idea that we have a "happiness set point," a level of happiness we tend to maintain throughout our lives, despite events we experience. This treadmill-like concept implies that no matter how hard one tries to be happier, one remains in the same place due to cognitive changes and neurochemical processes. These changes can include shifting values, goals, attention, and interpretation of a situation, as well as desensitization or sensitization to circumstances or environment.

**Examples**

1. **Winning the Lottery**: In Brickman's 1978 study, lottery winners reported being similarly happy before and after their windfall, eventually returning to their happiness set point.
2. **Life-altering Injuries**: Silver (1982) found that accident victims were able to return to a happiness set point after a period of time, demonstrating our tendency to adapt to significant negative events.
3. **Imprisonment**: Wildeman, Turney, and Schnittker's (2014) study revealed that while being in prison has negative effects on one’s baseline well-being, individuals are able to bounce back to their previous level of happiness upon release.

**Application**

Understanding hedonic adaptation can help us make more informed decisions about our lives. Recognizing that we have a happiness set point can encourage us to seek out experiences that provide lasting happiness rather than temporary highs. This might involve focusing on activities that promote long-term well-being, such as acts of kindness or developing strong relationships.

**Related Models**

1. **The Happiness Equation**: This model by Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert proposes that people tend to evaluate their lives based on a theory of how things should be, rather than how they are – a concept closely linked to hedonic adaptation.
2. **Flow**: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of flow describes the state of optimal experience, where individuals are fully immersed and focused on the present moment, providing a counterpoint to the idea that we quickly adapt to positive events.
3. **The Set Point Theory of Weight**: This theory, similar in nature to hedonic adaptation, posits that there is an individual weight set point that our bodies attempt to maintain, despite changes in diet or exercise habits.

In conclusion, understanding hedonic adaptation provides valuable insights into human happiness and its fluctuations. By acknowledging the existence of a happiness set point and seeking out experiences that promote long-term well-being, we can strive for a more fulfilling and balanced life.
