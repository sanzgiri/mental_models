# Prepare to Be Wrong

 Title: Prepare to Be Wrong: Embracing Uncertainty for Success

**Introduction**

The mental model "Prepare to Be Wrong" is a powerful tool that encourages individuals to anticipate and embrace the possibility of being incorrect in their decisions and actions. This model, although originally titled as an extended play (EP) by Straylight Run, has transcended the realm of music and found its way into the world of personal development, teaching us valuable lessons about adaptability, resilience, and growth.

**Core Concept**

The core concept behind "Prepare to Be Wrong" revolves around proactively accepting that errors and misjudgments are an inherent part of the decision-making process. Rather than fearing mistakes, we should anticipate them, learn from them, and use them as stepping stones towards progress. This mental model encourages us to develop a mindset that seeks out alternative perspectives, questions assumptions, and remains open to new information.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: In 2007, Netflix (NFLX) infamously launched Qwikster, a separate DVD service alongside their streaming service, only to discontinue it after just 49 days due to customer backlash. This example demonstrates the importance of being prepared to be wrong and adapting quickly based on feedback. [Investment Foresight](/models/investment-foresight) and [First Principles Thinking](/models/first-principles-thinking) can complement this model by encouraging thorough analysis and reevaluation of initial assumptions.
2. **Life**: In 2013, astronaut Scott Kelly embarked on a year-long mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). During this time, he conducted research on the effects of long-term space travel on the human body. Despite his extensive preparation and training, Kelly faced numerous challenges and unexpected setbacks that required him to adapt and adjust his approach. By embracing the possibility of being wrong and remaining flexible, Kelly was able to successfully complete his mission. [Anticipation](/models/anticipation) can help individuals anticipate potential obstacles and prepare accordingly when dealing with complex tasks or situations like space travel.
3. **History**: The Apollo 13 moon mission in 1970 experienced an oxygen tank explosion, placing the crew's lives in grave danger. Despite the odds, the astronauts and NASA team worked together to implement innovative solutions and safely return the crew to Earth. This historic event highlights the importance of being prepared for the unexpected and adapting quickly when faced with adversity.
