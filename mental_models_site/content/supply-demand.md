# Supply & Demand

 **Introduction**

The mental model of Supply & Demand is a fundamental economic principle that explains how prices are determined in a market. It postulates that the unit price for a good will vary until it settles at an equilibrium point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This equilibrium, achieved through the interaction of supply and demand, forms the theoretical basis of modern economics (Wikipedia Entry).

**Core Concept**

In simple terms, the Supply & Demand model suggests that when the price of a good is high, more sellers are incentivized to produce and sell it, increasing the supply. Conversely, when the price is low, demand for the good increases, but suppliers may produce less due to lower profit margins, thus decreasing the supply. The equilibrium price is where these forces balance out, leading to a point where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied (Wikipedia Entry).

The concept of supply and demand is graphically represented by supply and demand curves. A supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied by producers, while a demand curve represents the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at various prices. Both curves are typically downward-sloping, indicating that as price decreases, quantity demanded increases, and as price increases, quantity supplied increases (Wikipedia Entry).

**Examples**

1. In a business context, the pricing of smartphones is a classic example of supply & demand. When Apple released the iPhone 6, the high demand led to long waits for delivery and higher prices on the secondary market. This demonstrated that at the initial price point, the quantity demanded exceeded the quantity supplied (Wikipedia Entry).

2. In historical context, the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-19th century provides an example of a Giffen good, a product where an increase in price leads to an increase in consumption due to income effects. As the price of potatoes rose, the Irish peasants were forced to switch away from luxury goods like meat and toward more potatoes to maintain their caloric intake (Wikipedia Entry).

3. In environmental economics, the scarcity of clean water is a prime example of supply & demand. As the demand for clean water increases due to population growth and industrialization, the price of water rises, leading to innovations in technology and infrastructure to increase its supply (Wikipedia Entry).
