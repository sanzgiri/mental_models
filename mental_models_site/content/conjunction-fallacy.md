# Conjunction Fallacy

 **The Conjunction Fallacy: A Cognitive Bias in Reasoning**

The Conjunction Fallacy is a cognitive bias that manifests when individuals perceive a compound statement, consisting of two or more related events, as being more probable than one of the individual events. This fallacy, first identified by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, challenges our intuitive judgment and has far-reaching implications in various aspects of life.

**Core Concept**

The mechanism behind the Conjunction Fallacy revolves around our heuristics for making decisions under uncertainty. People often rely on representativeness—a mental shortcut that involves comparing new data with existing schemas or stereotypes—to make judgments about probabilities. In doing so, we may overlook basic probability rules and fall victim to the Conjunction Fallacy.

For example, if we have a description of a woman named Linda, who is politically engaged and concerned with social justice, most people would consider it more probable that she is both a bank teller and active in the feminist movement than just a bank teller (the "Linda Problem"). Logically, this conclusion is flawed because the probability of two events occurring together cannot exceed the probability of either event alone.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: A company might fall prey to the Conjunction Fallacy when analyzing market trends. For instance, if they notice that a certain demographic tends to buy both organic produce and exercise equipment, they may mistakenly assume that this segment is more likely to purchase both products together rather than one or the other.

2. **History**: During the Cold War, policy experts were asked about the likelihood of the Soviet Union invading Poland and the United States breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. A substantial number of these experts incorrectly believed that the joint event (both events occurring) was more probable than either event separately.

3. **Life**: In daily life, the Conjunction Fallacy can lead individuals to overestimate the likelihood of rare and specific outcomes. For example, when watching a tennis match, people might believe it's more probable that a player will lose the first set but go on to win the game, compared to simply losing the first set.

**Application**

Understanding the Conjunction Fallacy is essential for making informed decisions and avoiding cognitive biases. To avoid this fallacy in your daily life:

1. **Separate Events**: Analyze each event individually before considering their combined probability.
2. **Probability Rules**: Use basic probability rules to compare the likelihood of individual events versus compound events.
3. **Avoid Representativeness**: Be cautious when using representativeness as a heuristic, as it can sometimes lead to flawed judgments.

**Related Models**

1. [Availability Heuristics](/models/availability-heuristic): Like the Conjunction Fallacy, this mental model relies on our intuition and may lead us to overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind.
2. [Base Rate Neglect](/models/base-rate-neglect): This fallacy involves ignoring important base rates when making probability judgments, which can contribute to the Conjunction Fallacy.
