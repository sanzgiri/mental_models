# Genre

 **Introduction**

The mental model of Genre refers to a category or style of communication in various modes (written, spoken, digital, artistic, etc.) that possess socially agreed-upon conventions developed over time. In popular usage, it generally describes a classification of literature, music, art, or entertainment based on certain stylistic criteria. The model matters because it helps us make sense of the world and navigate through the vast amounts of information and artistic expression by providing frameworks for understanding and interpreting different works.

**Core Concept**

The concept of genre is rooted in ancient Greek literature, as outlined in Aristotle's Poetics. For Aristotle, poetry, prose, and performance each had specific features that supported appropriate content based on the genre. Over time, genres have evolved and expanded beyond Aristotle's classifications to adapt to changes in audiences and creators. Today, academia refers to the study of genres as "genre studies" or "genre theory."

**Examples**

1. **Literature**: Examples of literary genres include epic poetry (e.g., Homer's Iliad), tragedy (e.g., Shakespeare's Hamlet), comedy (e.g., Aristophanes' Lysistrata), and science fiction (e.g., H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds).

2. **Visual Arts**: In art history, genre painting involves human figures without specific identities, typically dealing with everyday life scenes rather than portraits or allegorical subjects. Examples include Vermeer's "The Milkmaid" and Velázquez's "Las Meninas."

3. **Music**: Music genres encompass a wide range of styles such as classical, jazz, rock, pop, and hip-hop. For instance, Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor is an example of Classical music, while The Beatles' "Hey Jude" belongs to the Rock genre.

4. **Popular Culture**: Genres play a significant role in popular culture, simplifying the search for products by consumers. Examples include film genres like action, romance, comedy, and horror (e.g., Die Hard, Titanic, Superbad, and The Exorcist).
