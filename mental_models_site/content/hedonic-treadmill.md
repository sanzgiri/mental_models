 Title: The Hedonic Treadmill: A Mental Model Exploring the Stability of Happiness

The Hedonic Treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is a fascinating mental model that postulates humans tend to quickly return to a stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events in life. This theory, coined by Brickman and Campbell in 1971, offers insights into the complex dynamics of human emotions and their relationship with our circumstances.

**Core Concept**

The Hedonic Treadmill is based on the idea of a "happiness set point" whereby individuals maintain relatively constant levels of happiness throughout their lives. This emotional equilibrium is maintained through cognitive changes such as shifting values, goals, attention, and interpretation of situations. The process can occur due to our tendency to construct elaborate rationales for considering ourselves deprived (abundance denial) or neurochemical processes that desensitize overstimulated hedonic pathways in the brain.

**Examples**

1. **Financial Gains and Losses**: Winning a lottery, while initially leading to increased happiness, tends to result in a return to one's original level of happiness as individuals adapt to their new financial circumstances. This was observed in Brickman's 1978 study on lottery winners and paraplegics.

2. **Traumatic Experiences**: Despite the initial shock, individuals often adapt to traumatic events such as imprisonment or severe accidents. For instance, Silver's (1982) research found that accident victims returned to their happiness set point after a period of time.

3. **Life Changes**: Life events like marriage, divorce, birth of a child, or job loss can temporarily affect one's happiness, but people tend to return to their baseline levels over time. This was demonstrated in Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, and Diener's (2003) study on changes in marital status, birth of a first child, and job loss.

**Application**

Understanding the Hedonic Treadmill can help individuals make informed decisions about life choices and expectations. It highlights the importance of setting realistic goals and managing expectations to maintain a stable level of happiness. Engaging in altruistic activities or cultivating positive relationships can also aid in returning to one's happiness set point more quickly after negative events.

**Related Models**

1. **Set Point Theory**: This model, closely related to the Hedonic Treadmill, suggests that there are stable levels of various psychological traits, including happiness and well-being.

2. **Optimal Experience (Flow)**: This model by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes a state of heightened focus and enjoyment during challenging activities, offering a complementary perspective on moments of intense positive emotions that can temporarily override the Hedonic Treadmill.

3. **Transhumanism**: This philosophical movement seeks to use technology to overcome limitations imposed by our biology, including the Hedonic Treadmill, with proposed solutions such as wireheading and genetic engineering.
