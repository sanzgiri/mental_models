 # Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy: Overemphasizing Patterns and Ignoring Reality

The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy, a captivating example of an informal logical fallacy, is a cognitive bias that can lead individuals to draw false conclusions by overemphasizing similarities while ignoring differences in data. Named after a humorous metaphor, this fallacy is reminiscent of a Texan who paints a bullseye on a barn after shooting at it, claiming to be an expert marksman.

## Core Concept

At its heart, the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy occurs when an individual focuses on a small subset of data and attributes a common property to it without considering other possible explanations. This fallacy is closely related to the multiple comparisons problem in statistics and apophenia in cognitive psychology, which both deal with the human tendency to perceive patterns where none truly exist.

The fallacy typically arises when someone has a large amount of data at their disposal but only concentrates on a specific subset. By attributing this common property to an irrelevant factor other than the actual cause, the individual is likely committing the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy.

This fallacy is characterized by two key features: 1) Lack of a specific hypothesis before data collection, or formation of a hypothesis only after examining the data; and 2) Testing the hypothesis on the same data from which it was derived (known as "hypotheses suggested by the data").

## Examples

1. **Power Line Health Effects Study**: In a Swedish study conducted over 25 years, researchers surveyed people living near high-voltage power lines and looked for statistically significant increases in various health issues. The study concluded that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those living closest to the power lines, leading to government action. However, this conclusion was flawed due to the multiple comparisons problem—the large number of potential ailments increased the probability of finding a statistically significant correlation with living distance from power lines by chance alone. Subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any association between power lines and childhood leukemia.

2. **Nostradamus Predictions**: Modern interpretations of Nostradamus's quatrains often display the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy. Quatrains are frequently translated liberally, losing historical context, and then applied to support the erroneous conclusion that Nostradamus predicted a given modern-day event after it occurred.

3. **Stock Market Trends**: Investors may commit the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy when they focus on a small subset of stocks that have performed exceptionally well, attributing their success to specific factors (e.g., industry or geographical location), and ignore other stocks that did not exhibit the same pattern.

## Application

Avoiding the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy requires careful consideration and critical thinking when analyzing data. It is essential to formulate a hypothesis before collecting data, test it on different sets of data, and ensure that the sample size is large enough to minimize the risk of false conclusions due to chance alone.
