# Ostrich Effect

 Title: The Ostrich Effect: Burying Your Head in the Sand when Facing Adversity

The Ostrich Effect, also known as the Ostrich Problem, is a fascinating cognitive bias that encourages individuals to avoid potentially negative but useful information to evade psychological discomfort. Named after the popular yet false legend of ostriches burying their heads in the sand to escape danger, this mental model sheds light on how humans often choose ignorance over facing reality.

## Core Concept

Neuroscientific evidence suggests that the Ostrich Effect arises from the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) of the brain. Tali Sharot's research reveals that participants presented with negative information were more likely to avoid updating their beliefs, and disrupting this part of the brain with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) made them more open to accepting negative information [1].

The Ostrich Effect can be attributed to several factors such as cognitive dissonance, trustability issues, and loss aversion. Individuals tend to experience psychological discomfort when confronted with information that contradicts their beliefs, leading to avoidance of seeking it (cognitive dissonance). Additionally, people are more likely to trust positive feedback than negative feedback, which can contribute to the Ostrich Effect [2]. Lastly, loss aversion—the tendency for people to feel the pain of losses more strongly than the pleasure of equivalent gains—can increase an individual's likelihood of displaying the Ostrich Effect by avoiding information on diagnosis [3].

## Examples

1. **Finance**: Investors often exhibit the Ostrich Effect by preferring financial investments with unreported risks over those with similar risk-return profiles but with frequently reported risks. This is due to their desire for blissful ignorance about the potential negative outcomes [4].
2. **Healthcare**: People diagnosed with diabetes may avoid monitoring their blood sugar levels, as it requires them to confront the reality of their condition and its potential complications [5].
3. **Climate and Energy**: The Ostrich Effect can also manifest in avoiding topics like climate change or energy depletion. When participants were presented with negative information about energy depletion, they were less likely to express interest in learning more about the issue [6].

## Application

Understanding the Ostrich Effect is crucial for making informed decisions and overcoming obstacles in various aspects of life. By recognizing when you might be exhibiting this cognitive bias, you can consciously work towards seeking out valuable information that may initially seem uncomfortable or daunting. This awareness empowers you to take control of your circumstances and make proactive choices based on a well-rounded understanding of the situation.

## Related Models

1. **Confirmation Bias**: A cognitive bias where individuals favor information that confirms their existing beliefs while disregarding evidence that contradicts them [7].
2. **Denial**: Similar to the Ostrich Effect, denial is a defense mechanism used to avoid facing difficult truths or reality [8].
3. **Selective Exposure**: A phenomenon in which individuals seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs while avoiding information that challenges them [9].
