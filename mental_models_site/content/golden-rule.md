 **The Golden Rule: A Comparative Study Across Religions**

The Golden Rule, a principle of ethics and reciprocity, is a fundamental concept in many religions and philosophies. Here's a comparative study across three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism.

**Judaism**
In Judaism, the Golden Rule is expressed as "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18). This commandment is considered one of the fundamental principles of Jewish ethics. Hillel the Elder, a prominent Jewish leader, used this verse to summarize the Torah's most important message.

**Christianity**
In Christianity, Jesus of Nazareth is known for his articulation of the Golden Rule during his Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 7:12). He expanded upon the negative formulation ("Do not do unto others what you would not want done to you") to a positive one ("Do to others as you would have them do to you").

**Buddhism**
In Buddhism, the principle of reciprocity is called the "Golden Rule of Reciprocity" or "Karma". It can be found in the Metta Sutta, where it is expressed as "Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful." This principle encourages kindness and compassion towards all living beings.

While the exact phrasing may vary across religions, the underlying concept of treating others with kindness, respect, and empathy remains consistent. This principle serves as a guiding light for ethical behavior in many belief systems, emphasizing mutual respect and reciprocity among individuals and communities.
