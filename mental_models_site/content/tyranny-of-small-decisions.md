# Tyranny of Small Decisions

 **Title: The Tyranny of Small Decisions: A Mental Model for Understanding Cumulative Impacts**

The mental model, "Tyranny of Small Decisions," highlights the phenomenon where a multitude of seemingly insignificant decisions collectively lead to substantial, often undesirable outcomes. First explored by American economist Alfred E. Kahn in 1966, this concept sheds light on market failures and extends its application to various domains like environmental degradation, political elections, and health outcomes.

**Core Concept:**
The Tyranny of Small Decisions arises from the discrepancy between short-term and long-term perspectives in decision-making. Individuals make small decisions based on immediate circumstances, unaware of their cumulative impact on larger, long-term decisions. The latter are typically high-stakes, "all-or-nothing" choices that can be irreversibly affected by the collective of small, seemingly innocuous decisions.

**Examples:**
1. **Ithaca Railroad**: In 1960s Ithaca, New York, passengers' daily travel choices between trains and other modes of transport led to the withdrawal of passenger railway services due to insufficient revenue. Although each decision seemed rational at the time, the cumulative effect caused a market failure that resulted in a loss for both passengers and the railroad ([Ithaca Railroad](/models/ithaca-railroad)).
2. **Environmental Degradation**: The destruction of marshlands along the coasts of Connecticut and Massachusetts between 1950 and 1970 was not a result of a single decision but rather hundreds of small decisions leading to habitat conversion ([William Odum](/models/william-odum)). Similar examples include the degradation of the Florida Everglades and the decline in green turtle populations.
3. **Cultural Lake Eutrophication**: Gradual environmental problems, such as lake eutrophication due to excessive nutrient input, often result from numerous small decisions concerning domestic sewage, industrial outfalls, housing developments, and agricultural practices.

**Application:**
To avoid falling victim to the Tyranny of Small Decisions, individuals should consider the long-term consequences of their choices and make decisions based on a holistic understanding of the system's interdependencies. This mindset can be especially useful in decision-making at work, home, or when participating in democratic processes.
