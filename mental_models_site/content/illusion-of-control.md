# Illusion of Control

 The Illusion of Control: Overestimating Our Ability to Influence Events
======================================================================

The mental model known as the "Illusion of Control" refers to a psychological phenomenon where individuals overestimate their ability to control events, even when there is no demonstrable link between their actions and the outcomes. First named by U.S. psychologist Ellen Langer, this cognitive bias has been linked to various aspects of human behavior, including gambling, belief in the paranormal, and perceptions of self-efficacy.

**Core Concept**
----------------

At its heart, the illusion of control arises from a lack of introspective insight into our actual level of control over events. Instead, people rely on an often unreliable process to judge their degree of control. This may lead them to attribute causality to themselves for events with little or no connection. For example, in one study, college students in a virtual reality setting believed they had as much control over an elevator as those who actually controlled it, based on feedback emphasizing success rather than failure (Langer, 1975).

**History**
-----------

Theories of the illusion of control have been present in psychological thought for decades. Alfred Adler argued that people strive for proficiency in their lives, while Heider proposed a strong human motive to control their environment. Wyatt Mann hypothesized a basic competence motive, and Wiener modified his achievement motivation theory to include a controllability dimension (Langer, 1975). More recently, Taylor and Brown argued that positive illusions like the illusion of control foster mental health.

**Examples**
-------------

1. Business: In the world of finance, traders may overestimate their ability to predict market trends, leading to risky investments based on perceived control rather than objective analysis (Thompson et al., 1998).
2. Life: Individuals with depression may have a more accurate view of their level of control compared to non-depressed individuals, suggesting that the illusion of control can be weakened in stressful or mentally unhealthy situations (Abramson & Alloy, 1978; Msetfi et al., 2005).
3. History: In the 2002 Olympics men's and women's hockey finals, Team Canada placed a coin under the ice before the game, believing it would bring them luck (Dykman et al., 1989). This illustrates how individuals may attempt to control uncontrollable events by transferring responsibility to others perceived as luckier.

**Application**
---------------

Understanding the illusion of control can help individuals make more informed decisions by encouraging a realistic appraisal of their level of control in various situations. For example, recognizing that success in a given task may be largely determined by chance rather than personal skills or effort can lead to better risk management and decision-making.

**Related Models**
------------------

1. Illusory Superiority (Lake Wobegon Effect): The belief that one is above average in various abilities, even when objective data suggests otherwise.
2. Optimism Bias: The tendency to expect positive outcomes and underestimate the likelihood of negative events.
3. Hindsight Bias: The tendency to believe that past events were predictable once they have occurred. These cognitive biases often coexist with the illusion of control, contributing to overconfidence and irrational decision-making.

**Benefits and Costs to the Individual**
----------------------------------------

While the illusion of control can provide motivation and resilience in some situations, it can also lead to maladaptive beliefs, poor decision-making, and increased risk-taking (Taylor & Brown, 1988; Bandura, 1989). Understanding the factors that contribute to this cognitive bias can help individuals strike a balance between optimism and realism in their self-assessments and decision-making processes.
