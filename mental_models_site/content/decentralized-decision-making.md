# Decentralized Decision Making

 **Introduction**

Decentralized Decision Making is a mental model that involves distributing decision-making authority throughout a larger group, rather than concentrating it at the top levels of an organization or hierarchy. This model has significant implications for management, organizational behavior, and governance, as it encourages creativity, fosters collaboration, and promotes flexibility.

**Core Concept**

The core concept behind Decentralized Decision Making is rooted in the idea that collective intelligence and crowd wisdom can generate more effective decisions than those made by a single individual or small group at the top of an organization. This approach allows for many minds to work simultaneously on problems, accommodates flexibility, and caters to individual needs. The process encourages motivation and creativity, resulting in less organizational rigidity and flatter hierarchies.

The decision-making process in a decentralized system is based on group intelligence, which combines the knowledge, skills, and experiences of each member. This collective knowledge can lead to better decisions, as it benefits from diverse perspectives and the elimination of potential biases that might exist within individual decision-makers.

**Examples**

1. **Business Example - IBM's Turnaround:** Louis Gerstner Jr., former CEO of IBM, implemented a decentralized approach during IBM's historic turnaround in the early 2000s. By giving more autonomy to business units and employees, he created an environment that encouraged innovation and fostered creativity, leading to IBM's resurgence as a leader in technology services.

2. **Historical Example - The Roman Empire:** Decentralization was evident in the Roman Empire, where provincial governors held significant decision-making authority. This allowed for efficient administration and local problem-solving, contributing to Rome's vast expansion during its Golden Age (31 BC – 180 AD).

3. **Modern Example - Wikipedia:** Wikipedia is a prime example of decentralized decision making in action. Thousands of volunteers worldwide collaborate to create, edit, and maintain the online encyclopedia, demonstrating the power of collective intelligence and crowd wisdom.

**Application**

To apply the Decentralized Decision Making mental model in your daily life or decision-making process, consider empowering others by delegating tasks or responsibilities, soliciting feedback, and encouraging open communication. By doing so, you can tap into diverse perspectives, foster creativity, and make more informed decisions.

**Related Models**

1. [Collective Intelligence](/models/collective-intelligence) - This mental model emphasizes the power of collaboration and collective knowledge in problem-solving and decision-making.
2. [Groupthink](/models/groupthink) - While related, Groupthink is a negative phenomenon where group members rationalize, ignore, or suppress conflicts and disagreements to reach a consensus quickly, potentially leading to poor decisions. Decentralized Decision Making aims to mitigate this risk by encouraging diverse perspectives and open communication.
