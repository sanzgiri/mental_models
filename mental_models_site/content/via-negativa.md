 # Apophatic and Cataphatic Theology: Via Negativa

Apophatic (or negative) and cataphatic (or affirmative) theologies are two complementary approaches to understanding the nature of God in Christian mysticism, particularly prominent in Neo-Platonism. They were developed by philosophers such as Plotinus and Proclus, and later influenced Early Church Fathers like Pseudo-Dionysius and Maximus the Confessor.

## Apophatic Theology (Via Negativa)

Apophatic theology emphasizes the incomprehensible and transcendent nature of God, acknowledging that human language and understanding are insufficient to fully describe or grasp the divine. It is often referred to as the "via negativa," or the "negative way." This approach advocates for the realization of God's unknowability and encourages contemplation, silence, and a surrender of human reason in order to experience union with the divine.

Plotinus, the founder of Neo-Platonism, was one of the earliest proponents of apophatic theology. He emphasized the simplicity and ineffable nature of the One, arguing that it transcends all knowledge and understanding. According to Plotinus, true union with the One can only be achieved through an ascent of the soul by abstraction or "taking away," culminating in a sudden appearance of the One.

## Cataphatic Theology (Via Affirmativa)

Cataphatic theology, on the other hand, seeks to describe God using positive attributes and affirmations. It is often referred to as the "via affirmativa," or the "affirmative way." This approach acknowledges that while human understanding is limited, there are certain qualities and aspects of God that can be affirmed and described based on divine revelation.

Cataphatic theology emphasizes God's love, goodness, wisdom, power, and other positive attributes revealed in the Scriptures. It argues that even though these attributes do not fully describe the essence of God, they offer a means to approach and understand God more closely.

## Interplay between Apophatic and Cataphatic Theology

Both apophatic and cataphatic theologies are considered complementary in understanding the nature of God. While apophatic theology emphasizes God's transcendence and ineffability, cataphatic theology offers affirmations that guide believers toward a deeper understanding and experience of the divine.

Proclus, a prominent Neo-Platonist philosopher, suggested that apophatic and cataphatic theologies form a contemplative pair. The apophatic approach corresponds to the manifestation of the world from the One, while the cataphatic approach corresponds to the return to the One. The affirmations serve as guiding principles towards the unknowable One, with the negations serving as foundational underpinnings for these confirmations.

## Influence on Christianity

Apophatic and cataphatic theologies have significantly influenced Christian mysticism and spirituality. Early Church Fathers like Origen, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor all drew upon these philosophical ideas to interpret the nature of God and human spiritual growth. For example, the experience of God's "still small voice" in 1 Kings 19:12, also known as the "silence of the perpetual choir in heaven," has mystical connotations that align with apophatic theology.
