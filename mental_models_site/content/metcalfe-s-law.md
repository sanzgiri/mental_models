# Metcalfe's Law

 **Introduction**

Metcalfe's Law is a fundamental mental model in understanding the value and influence of communication networks, including the internet, social networking platforms, and other forms of interconnected systems. Named after Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, this law explains how the financial value or impact of a network grows as the square of the number of connected users (n²).

**Core Concept**

The core concept behind Metcalfe's Law is that the worth of a network increases exponentially with the addition of each new user. This growth in value can be mathematically expressed as the total number of unique possible connections, which for an n-node connection can be calculated as `n(n-1)/2`, asymptotically proportional to `n²`. This means that each new user adds significant value to the network, and this value is not linearly related to the number of users but instead grows rapidly.

**Examples**

1. **Internet**: The internet is one of the most obvious examples of Metcalfe's Law in action. As more people connect to the internet, the value of the network increases exponentially, as users can communicate, share information, and access a growing number of online resources.
2. **Social Networking Platforms**: Services like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn demonstrate the power of Metcalfe's Law in real-world settings. The more people that join these platforms, the more valuable they become, as users can connect with friends, family, colleagues, and acquaintances from around the world.
3. **Telecommunications**: In the early days of telephones and fax machines, the usefulness of each device was directly proportional to the number of similar devices in use. A single fax machine was virtually useless without other fax machines to send and receive documents. As more fax machines were introduced into the network, their value increased significantly.

**Application**

Understanding Metcalfe's Law can help individuals make informed decisions when investing in or participating in networks. Whether it be joining a social networking site, starting a new business, or adopting a new technology, considering the potential for network effects according to Metcalfe's Law can provide valuable insights into the long-term value and impact of these choices.

**Related Models**

1. [Reed's Law](/models/reeds-law) – A related concept that builds upon Metcalfe’s Law, suggesting that the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of connections between users, rather than just the total number of users.
2. [Sarnoff's Law](/models/sarnoffs-law) – Another mental model focusing on the value of networks, which states that the value of a communication network increases as the square root of the number of messages sent over time.
