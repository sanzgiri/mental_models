# Prospect Theory

 **Prospect Theory** is an economic theory that describes how people make decisions under risk, especially when the outcomes have both gains and losses. It was developed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979 as a more realistic alternative to expected utility theory. Here are some key points about Prospect Theory:

1. **Value function**: The value function describes how people evaluate gains (positive outcomes) and losses (negative outcomes). In Prospect Theory, the value function is S-shaped. It is concave for gains (indicating risk aversion when gaining) and convex for losses (indicating risk seeking when losing).

2. **Reference point**: All evaluations are made with respect to a reference point. This reference point can be influenced by previous experiences or social comparisons. If the outcome is better than the reference point, it is considered a gain; if it is worse, it is a loss.

3. **Loss aversion**: People tend to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. This means that losses hurt more than gains feel good, leading to risk-averse behavior when gaining and risk-seeking behavior when losing.

4. **Decision weights**: Prospect Theory also introduces decision weights, which are used to compute the utility of a decision. The decision weight of each possible outcome is determined by its probability and its relative desirability (i.e., distance from the reference point). Decision weights are never linear; they are closer to unity when probabilities are low than when they are high.

5. **Dominance principle**: If one prospect dominates another, meaning that it always yields a better outcome regardless of the realization of the uncertain events, then individuals will always choose the dominating prospect over the other.

Prospect Theory has important implications for decision-making under uncertainty and has been applied in various fields such as economics, psychology, and finance. It helps explain various phenomena, such as the endowment effect, framing effects, and risk-taking behaviors. However, it is also a complex theory with many assumptions and limitations, and its predictions are not always consistent with empirical findings.
