# Ad Hominem Attack

 **Introduction**

The mental model of Ad Hominem Attack refers to a type of argument where instead of addressing the substance of an argument, the speaker attacks the character or personal attributes of the person making the argument. This tactic is used to divert attention from the original debate and create a disruption in the conversation, often employing irrelevant or highly charged information about the opponent. The Ad Hominem Attack is a common fallacy that has been studied since ancient Greece and is considered a form of informal logical error.

**Core Concept**

The core concept of the Ad Hominem Attack involves attacking the person rather than their argument or evidence. This strategy can be effective in creating emotional responses, distracting from the main topic, and discrediting the opponent without addressing the validity of their points. The most common form of this fallacy is known as "tu quoque," where the speaker defends themselves by pointing out the hypocrisy or inconsistency of their opponent.

**Examples**

1. **Business Example:** In a public debate about business ethics, Company A is criticized for its environmental practices. Instead of addressing the concerns, Company A's representative counters that a competitor has been involved in similar controversies in the past. The representative's response shifts the focus from the original issue to the competitor's actions, avoiding an honest discussion about the company's environmental record.

2. **Historical Example:** During the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, William Jennings Bryan, a lawyer and politician who opposed the teaching of evolution, attacked Clarence Darrow, the attorney defending John Scopes. Instead of engaging with Darrow's arguments, Bryan focused on personal attacks, such as questioning Darrow's morality and character, to undermine his credibility and divert attention from the scientific evidence presented during the trial.

3. **Modern Politics Example:** In a political debate, Candidate A accuses Candidate B of accepting campaign donations from controversial sources. Rather than refuting the claim or providing evidence to support their position, Candidate B counters with personal attacks against Candidate A, accusing them of corruption and dishonesty. This response shifts the focus away from the original allegation and creates an emotional response that may sway undecided voters.

**Application**

To avoid falling victim to Ad Hominem Attacks, it is essential to remain focused on the substance of arguments and refrain from personal attacks. When engaging in a debate or discussion, it's crucial to address the issues at hand and provide evidence to support your points, rather than focusing on the character or personal attributes of the other party.

**Related Models**

1. [Genetic Fallacy](/models/genetic-fallacy): The Genetic Fallacy involves judging an argument based solely on its source, such as the person, institution, or culture that originated it, rather than evaluating the argument itself.
2. [Fallacy of Circular Reasoning](/models/circular-reasoning): This fallacy occurs when an argument uses a conclusion as one of its premises, creating a self-reinforcing loop without providing any new information or evidence.
