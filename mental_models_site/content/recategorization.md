# Recategorization

 **Introduction**
Recategorization is a mental model that signifies a change in the representation of a group or groups, resulting in a more inclusive and unified identity. This shift can significantly mitigate bias and promote prosocial behavior, making it an essential tool for fostering unity and cooperation in various social contexts.

**Core Concept**
The common ingroup identity model is the theoretical backbone of recategorization. It suggests that sharing a common identity with another person or group triggers positive treatment due to ingroup bias, the tendency to favor members within one's own group. Recategorization offers a solution to reduce these biases by broadening existing identities or encouraging self-categorization into a more inclusive identity known as a superordinate group identity. Superordinate groups can be defined by common group identity, shared goals, or perceived shared fate, and are associated with increased prosocial behavior.

**Examples**
1. **Business**: Mergers and acquisitions often require recategorization to foster unity between two companies. By emphasizing shared goals such as growth and success, employees from both companies can be encouraged to identify with the new, unified entity, thereby reducing bias and promoting cooperation.
2. **History**: The civil rights movement in the United States is an example of recategorization at work. The movement aimed to unite various racial and ethnic groups under a common identity as American citizens, which helped reduce bias and promote prosocial behavior towards each other and towards social change.
3. **Life**: In multicultural communities, recategorization can be used to promote unity and cooperation between different cultural groups. By emphasizing shared values such as respect for diversity, inclusivity, and community, individuals from various cultures can come together as part of a larger, unified group.

**Application**
In daily life, recategorization can help reduce bias and promote understanding in interpersonal relationships, workplaces, and communities. By focusing on common goals or shared values, individuals can shift their identity to include others who may have previously been perceived as "other." This mental model can also be applied in decision-making processes by considering the potential for recategorization as a means of reducing bias and promoting cooperation.

**Related Models**
1. **Social Identity Theory**: Recategorization is closely related to Social Identity Theory, which explains how people categorize themselves based on group membership and seek positive distinctiveness for their ingroup.
2. **Self-Categorization Theory**: This theory proposes that group membership is mutable and that people categorize themselves based on the fit and accessibility of different groups, similar to the mechanism behind recategorization.

**Conclusion**
Recategorization offers a powerful tool for reducing bias, promoting prosocial behavior, and fostering unity in diverse social contexts. By focusing on shared identities or values, individuals can shift their perception of others from "them" to "us," thereby creating a more inclusive and cooperative society. Understanding recategorization can help us navigate the complexities of human interaction and promote positive change in our personal lives, communities, and beyond.
