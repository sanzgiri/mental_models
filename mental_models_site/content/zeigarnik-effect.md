# Zeigarnik Effect

 **Introduction**

The Zeigarnik Effect is a fascinating mental model in psychology, named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik. This model postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed ones, providing insights into human memory and cognition. Understanding the Zeigarnik Effect matters because it can help us optimize our daily routines, improve learning, and make more effective decisions in both personal and professional life.

**Core Concept**

The Zeigarnik Effect is rooted in Kurt Lewin's field theory, which suggests that a task that has started creates a 'task-specific tension.' This tension enhances the cognitive accessibility of related contents, making them more easily remembered. When a task is completed, this tension dissipates; however, if it's interrupted, the continuous tension keeps the content more accessible and memorable.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: Unfinished projects or tasks consume mental energy, keeping them at the forefront of our minds. This can be both beneficial and detrimental – for instance, it helps us remember important tasks, but it can also lead to stress and anxiety if the workload is overwhelming.
2. **Life**: In our daily lives, this effect can manifest in habits like leaving chores undone or maintaining ongoing projects. These unfinished activities tend to linger in our minds longer than completed ones.
3. **History**: The Zeigarnik Effect played a role in the evolution of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Critics often criticized players for repeatedly shooting free throws when fouled, creating a stoppage of play and building up cognitive bias against this move, known as the Harden Rule.

**Application**

The Zeigarnik Effect can be applied in various ways:
- **Study Techniques**: Taking breaks while studying, leaving unfinished notes or assignments, and using progress trackers can help improve memory retention by leveraging this effect.
- **Product Design**: Digital platforms often use gamification techniques like checklists and progress bars to onboard users more effectively.
- **Creative Writing**: Cliffhangers in fiction rely on the Zeigarnik Effect, maintaining attention and heightening suspense by leaving readers with unresolved plot points.

**Related Models**

1. [Closure Principle](/models/closure-principle) - This mental model posits that people have a strong desire to complete tasks or resolve problems, providing another perspective on the motivation behind the Zeigarnik Effect.
2. [Sunk Cost Fallacy](/models/sunk-cost-fallacy) - This cognitive bias is related in that it involves continued investment in an endeavor due to previously invested resources, despite evidence of its unprofitability or futility.
