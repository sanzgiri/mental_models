# Adverse Selection

 **Introduction**

In economics, adverse selection refers to a market situation where asymmetric information leads one party to take advantage of undisclosed information, thereby benefiting disproportionately from a contract or trade. This mental model matters because it can cause market collapse and lead to unfair outcomes for both buyers and sellers.

**Core Concept**

In an ideal world, buyers pay a price reflecting their willingness to pay, and sellers sell at a price reflecting the quality of their goods or services. However, when one party holds more information than the other, they can maximize self-utility by concealing relevant information and potentially even lying. This can lead to several negative effects: parties may avoid entering into unfair contracts, ask for higher or lower prices, diminishing trade volume; or be deterred from participating in the market, resulting in less competition and higher profit margins for participants ([Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection)).

**Examples**

1. **Insurance**: Adverse selection was first described for life insurance, where individuals with high-risk factors, such as smokers or those with pre-existing conditions, tend to buy more insurance than lower-risk individuals, leading to higher claims and increased costs for insurers. To counteract this, insurers may require premiums that reflect the customer's risk, asking questions about health status and rejecting high-risk individuals (cf. pre-existing condition).

2. **Capital Markets**: When companies raise capital through equity offerings, adverse selection can occur if managers sell stock when they know the offer price exceeds their private assessment of the company's value. Outside investors, therefore, require a high rate of return to compensate for the risk of buying a "lemon." Debt offerings are less prone to adverse selection since they act as signals that the firm's management believes the current stock price is undervalued ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adverseselection.asp)).

3. **Banking**: Adverse selection is deeply rooted in personal loans, mortgages, and business loans discussions between banks and borrowers. Borrowers possess information about their financial status that banks do not have, allowing them to take an economic advantage. To counteract this, banks build stronger relationships with customers, adjust interest rates, implement heavier screening on loan applicants, and limit lending for some borrowers ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adverseselection.asp)).

**Application**

To avoid adverse selection in your daily life or decision-making, always strive to have as much information as possible about the products or services you are buying or selling. If you're a consumer, research the product and its providers before making a purchase. If you're a business owner, provide full disclosure of relevant information to potential investors or clients.

**Reducing Adverse Selection**

To reduce adverse selection's effects, encourage transparency between both sides of the market by implementing reputation systems (e.g., online marketplaces) and screening mechanisms for initial decisions in participating in a contract.
