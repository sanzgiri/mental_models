# Anchoring

 Anchoring is a mental model that refers to the human tendency to rely too heavily on the initial piece of information (the 'anchor') that we encounter when making decisions or forming opinions, especially in situations where we lack complete knowledge. This cognitive bias can significantly impact our decision-making processes and lead us to make suboptimal choices.

The anchoring effect arises from the way our brain processes information. We often use a benchmark or an initial piece of data (the 'anchor') as a reference point, which influences our subsequent judgments and decisions. This 'anchoring' can be influenced by various factors such as the context in which the information is presented, our mood at the time, or even our own biases and experiences.

## Real-world Examples:

1. **Negotiations**: In negotiations, anchors are often used strategically to set an initial offer that serves as a reference point for subsequent offers. For example, a car salesperson might start with an excessive asking price to 'anchor' the buyer's expectations, making a lower final offer seem more reasonable.

2. **Pricing Strategies**: Companies sometimes use anchoring in pricing strategies by comparing their product to a higher-priced alternative (the anchor). For example, advertising a smartphone as "now 50% off its original price" implies that the original price was much higher, making the discounted price seem more attractive.

3. **Salary Negotiations**: During salary negotiations, job candidates may be anchored by the initial salary offer, even if it is significantly lower than their expected or deserved compensation. This can lead to them accepting an unfair offer.

4. **Marketing and Advertising**: Marketing campaigns often use anchoring by highlighting a premium feature or benefit (the anchor) and then emphasizing other, less significant features as additional benefits. For example, a car commercial might first showcase the luxurious interior (the anchor) and then mention fuel efficiency as another advantage.
