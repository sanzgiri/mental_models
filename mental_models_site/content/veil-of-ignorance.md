# Veil of Ignorance

 The Veil of Ignorance is a thought-provoking mental model that imagines a hypothetical scenario in which individuals are unaware of their specific roles, characteristics, and circumstances in society when choosing fundamental principles for the structure of that same society. This concept was popularized by American philosopher John Rawls in his seminal work "A Theory of Justice" (1971).

In this original position, everyone is behind a veil of ignorance, which prevents them from knowing factors such as ethnicity, social status, gender, and personal ideas about a good life. By removing these biases, participants would theoretically adopt an impartial and rational approach to selecting principles that are fair and just for all members of society.

The idea of the Veil of Ignorance has its roots in earlier philosophical works, including John Stuart Mill's discussions on social contract, Immanuel Kant's ideal observer theory, and Adam Smith's "impartial spectator." However, it was John Harsanyi who mathematically formalized this concept to argue for utilitarianism rather than a social contract.

In the original position, Rawls proposed that representatives would select two principles of justice:
1. Each citizen is guaranteed a fully adequate scheme of basic liberties, which is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all others.
2. Social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions:
   - To the greatest benefit of the least advantaged (the difference principle)
   - Attached to positions and offices open to all

The Veil of Ignorance encourages us to think about fairness and justice from an impartial perspective, ensuring that decisions are made in a way that benefits the most vulnerable members of society. This model has influenced various philosophers, and its principles have been applied to different areas such as political theory, ethics, and even population genetics.

In our daily lives, we can apply the Veil of Ignorance by making decisions as if we were unaware of our own circumstances and considering how those decisions might impact others, especially the least advantaged members of society. By doing so, we promote fairness and strive for a more equitable distribution of resources.

Related mental models that complement the Veil of Ignorance include the [Divide and Choose](/models/divide-and-choose) model, which explores how individuals make decisions when faced with limited resources, and [Justice as Fairness: A Restatement](/models/justice-as-fairness-a-restatement), an updated version of Rawls's original theory.
