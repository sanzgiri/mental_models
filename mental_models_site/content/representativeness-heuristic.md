# Representativeness Heuristic

 **Introduction**

The Representativeness Heuristic is a psychological phenomenon that plays a significant role in decision-making and judgement processes. It was proposed by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the 1970s as a shortcut for evaluating the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a prototypical event or stereotype. This mental model is crucial because it sheds light on various cognitive biases and errors that people often commit when making judgments and decisions.

**Core Concept**

The Representativeness Heuristic operates by comparing an event to a prototype or stereotype that we already have in mind. For example, if we encounter a person who dresses eccentrically and reads poetry books, we might be more likely to think they are a poet than an accountant because their appearance and behavior are more representative of the stereotype of a poet. However, this heuristic can also lead to errors in judgment as the similarity between an event and a prototype does not necessarily reflect its actual likelihood.

**Examples**

1. **Medical Beliefs:** People often believe that medical symptoms should resemble their causes or treatments. For instance, people have long believed that stress causes ulcers due to the Representativeness Heuristic, even though bacteria are the real culprits. Similarly, some alternative medicine beliefs encourage patients to eat organ meat corresponding to their medical disorder.

2. **Diagnosis:** Clinicians may also be influenced by the Representativeness Heuristic when making diagnoses. They often judge similarity based on how closely a patient's symptoms match the stereotypical or prototypical patient with a specific disorder.

3. **The Taxicab Problem:** In this classic example, people tend to ignore base rates and focus solely on the resemblance between the hypothesis and data. For instance, if a cab identified as blue has a 12% chance of being actually blue and a 17% chance of being misidentified as blue, most people incorrectly estimate that the probability of the cab being blue is around 40%, neglecting the base rate of cabs being blue in the first place.

**Biases Attributed to the Representativeness Heuristic**

The use of the Representativeness Heuristic can lead to several biases, including:

1. **Base Rate Neglect:** People tend to ignore base rates (the basic incidence of an event) when solving probability problems, leading to what is known as the Base Rate Fallacy. This bias was explicitly tested in various studies, showing that people often fail to take base rates into account when making judgments.

2. **Gambler's Fallacy and Conjunction Fallacy:** The Representativeness Heuristic contributes to both the Gambler's Fallacy (the belief that past events can influence future independent events) and the Conjunction Fallacy (judging specific events as less probable than general ones, even when the opposite is true).

**Conclusion**

Understanding the Representativeness Heuristic is essential for recognizing cognitive biases and improving decision-making processes. By being aware of this mental model, we can strive to minimize errors in judgement and make more informed, rational decisions.
