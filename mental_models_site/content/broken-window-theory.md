 **The Broken Window Theory: A Powerful Mental Model for Crime Prevention and Beyond**

The Broken Window Theory is a criminological concept that suggests visible signs of crime, antisocial behavior, and civil disorder create an environment that encourages further criminal activity. Originally introduced in 1982 by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, the theory has become a significant influence on urban planning and policing strategies worldwide.

**Core Concept**

The Broken Window Theory is based on three factors: social norms and conformity, routine monitoring, and social signaling and signal crimes. In an anonymous urban environment, individuals look for signals as to the social norms in the setting and the risk of getting caught violating those norms. An ordered and clean environment sends a message that criminal behavior is not tolerated, while a disordered one suggests it is not monitored.

The theory emphasizes that people shape space (informal social control) and space shapes people (spatial exclusion and social division). A community's culture can deteriorate over time due to unwanted people and behaviors changing the landscape. By removing unwanted disorderly people, residents feel safer and have a higher regard for those that protect them.

**Examples**

1. **New York City in the 1990s**: Under police commissioner William Bratton, New York City enforced the Broken Windows Theory by targeting minor crimes such as vandalism, loitering, public drinking, and fare evasion. This led to a significant reduction in overall crime rates during his tenure.
2. **Japan's Cleanliness Obsession**: Japan's strict laws against littering and graffiti are rooted in the Broken Windows Theory. The country's emphasis on orderliness contributes to its low crime rate and safe environment.
3. **Defensible Space Theory**: Oscar Newman's Defensible Space Theory, introduced in 1972, complements the Broken Windows Theory by emphasizing the role of community engagement and investment in maintaining a safe neighborhood.

**Application**

In our daily lives, applying the Broken Window Theory means taking responsibility for maintaining order in our communities. This can be as simple as reporting minor crimes or cleaning up litter in public spaces to signal that the area is monitored and crime is not tolerated.
