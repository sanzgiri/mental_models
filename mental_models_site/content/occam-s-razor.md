# Occam's Razor

 **Introduction**

Occam's Razor, also known as Ockham's Razor or Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem, is a problem-solving principle that advises to prefer the simplest explanation for a given phenomenon. Attributed to William of Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher and theologian, it is frequently cited as "of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred." This mental model matters because it guides us towards more efficient and accurate problem-solving by advocating for minimal assumptions.

**Core Concept**

Occam's Razor suggests that when presented with multiple explanations for a given phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions should be favored. It is based on the assumption that unnecessary complications increase the probability of error and make theories less testable. The principle does not necessarily choose between hypotheses that make different predictions but serves as an abductive heuristic in developing theoretical models.

**Examples**

The razor's statement, "other things being equal, simpler explanations are generally better than more complex ones," can be empirically tested. If the simplest hypothesis leads to correct conclusions more often than not, it lends support to Occam's Razor as a useful tool. In economics, for instance, studies have shown that complexity in forecasting methods tends to increase errors by an average of 27%.

**Justifications**

The aesthetic and empirical justifications for Occam's Razor vary. Aesthetically, the principle is rooted in nature's simplicity, with simpler hypotheses being more likely to be true due to their alignment with human thought's appreciation of simplicity. Empirically, simpler theories are generally better testable and falsifiable, offering a greater empirical content.

**Practical considerations and pragmatism**

Mathematically, Occam's Razor can be justified by basic probability theory, as all assumptions introduce possibilities for error. By preferring simpler theories, we minimize the introduction of unnecessary assumptions that increase the overall probability that a theory is wrong.
