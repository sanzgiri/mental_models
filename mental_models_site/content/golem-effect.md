 Title: Understanding the Golem Effect: A Psychological Phenomenon that Influences Performance and Expectations

The Golem Effect, named after the legendary clay creature from Jewish mythology, is a psychological phenomenon that underscores the negative consequences of lower expectations placed upon individuals by supervisors or themselves. This intriguing mental model holds significant importance as it reveals how our beliefs can shape reality, often leading to self-fulfilling prophecies.

**Core Concept**

The Golem Effect operates on the premise that when individuals are subjected to lower expectations, their performance tends to deteriorate. This phenomenon is closely related to the Pygmalion Effect, where higher expectations lead to improved performance. The Golem Effect is most prominent in educational and organizational settings. It originates from a cycle of behavior where lowered expectations result in less effort from individuals, leading to poorer performance which, in turn, confirms and reinforces the initial low expectations (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968).

**Examples**

1. **Education**: In a seminal study by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968), they found that when teachers were told that certain students had high potential, those students demonstrated more significant improvements in IQ scores compared to their peers. Conversely, when labeling students as slow learners, these students showed little or no improvement.

2. **Workplace**: A study by Schrank (1970) on US Air Force Academy airmen revealed that when individuals were assigned to a "low-ability" group, they performed significantly worse than their peers in the same situation.

3. **History**: The Golem Effect can be traced back to historical events as well. For instance, the treatment of African American students in the Jim Crow South provides an example where lower expectations led to poorer educational outcomes and self-fulfilling prophecies (Steinberg, 1967).

**Application**

Understanding the Golem Effect is crucial for individuals and organizations seeking to maximize potential and foster growth. By acknowledging and challenging low expectations, we can break free from the cycle of poor performance. Encouraging self-belief, providing constructive feedback, and setting high yet realistic goals are all strategies that can help counteract the Golem Effect and cultivate a positive mindset conducive to success.

**Related Models**

1. **Pygmalion Effect**: As mentioned earlier, the Pygmalion Effect is closely related to the Golem Effect but emphasizes the positive consequences of higher expectations.

2. **Stanford Prison Experiment**: This famous social psychology study demonstrated how participants' roles and expectations influenced their behavior within a simulated prison environment (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973).

In conclusion, the Golem Effect is an essential mental model to understand as it highlights the profound impact that expectations can have on individual and collective performance. By being aware of this phenomenon, we can strive to create environments that foster growth and development, ultimately setting ourselves up for success.
