# Gambler's Fallacy

 **The Gambler's Fallacy: A Misunderstood Mental Model**

The Gambler's Fallacy is a cognitive bias that arises when individuals believe that the occurrence of an event in the short-term can influence its probability in the long-run. It is a common mistake made by gamblers who assume that if a particular outcome, such as a series of red numbers on a roulette wheel, has occurred frequently in the past, it is due to "streak" or imbalance and thus the opposite outcome (black) will occur more frequently in the future.

**Understanding the Fallacy**

The Gambler's Fallacy arises out of a belief in the law of small numbers. People tend to believe that small samples must be representative of the larger population, and that streaks must eventually even out to be representative. This leads to the erroneous assumption that past events can predict future outcomes.

This mental model is often associated with the representativeness heuristic, a psychological heuristic that suggests people evaluate the probability of an event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before and how similar the surrounding context is.

**Examples and Non-examples**

The Gambler's Fallacy is most commonly demonstrated in games of chance like roulette, where individuals may assume that a series of red numbers means a black number is due to appear next. However, it can also manifest in other situations, such as expecting the birth of a child of the opposite sex after multiple children of the same sex, or assuming that a biased coin will land on tails more frequently if it has landed on heads multiple times in a row.

On the other hand, the Gambler's Fallacy does not apply when the probability of different events is not independent, such as card games where cards are drawn without replacement. In these cases, the probability of future events can change based on the outcome of past events, allowing for strategies like card counting.

**Implications and Psychology**

The Gambler's Fallacy has significant implications in various fields, from gambling to finance, psychology, and even probability theory. Understanding this mental model can help individuals make more informed decisions, avoid falling victim to cognitive biases, and improve their ability to predict future outcomes accurately.

In terms of psychology, the Gambler's Fallacy is often studied as an example of how people make decisions based on incomplete or misleading information, and how these biases can lead to errors in judgment and decision-making.

**Origins**

The Gambler's Fallacy was first described by Pierre-Simon Laplace in his 1796 essay "A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities." Since then, it has been extensively studied and is now a well-known phenomenon in the fields of psychology, probability theory, and decision making.
