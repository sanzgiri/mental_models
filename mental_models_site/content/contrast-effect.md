# Contrast Effect

 **Introduction**

The Contrast Effect is a powerful mental model that shapes our perception, cognition, and decision-making processes in various ways. It refers to the enhancement or diminishment of these aspects as a result of successive or simultaneous exposure to stimuli of lesser or greater value in the same dimension. Understanding this effect can help us make more informed decisions, improve our critical thinking, and navigate complex situations more effectively.

**Core Concept**

The Contrast Effect operates on two main types: Simultaneous Contrast and Successive Contrast. Simultaneous Contrast occurs when the perception of a stimulus is influenced by its surrounding environment. For instance, a gray target may appear lighter or darker depending on whether it's surrounded by light or dark colors. Successive Contrast, on the other hand, happens when the perception of one stimulus is affected by a previous one. An example would be looking at two identical orange disks; after focusing on the first disk, the second disk may appear to have a different color due to the influence of the preceding disk.

The mechanism behind the Contrast Effect involves both physiological processes (e.g., connections between neurons in the visual cortex) and psychological factors. It serves an evolutionary purpose by enhancing edges in the visual field, thereby facilitating the recognition of shapes and objects.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: A car dealership might present a brand new, top-of-the-line model first to potential customers, making all subsequent cars seem less attractive by comparison, even if they are just slightly inferior models. This is an example of Successive Contrast at play.
2. **Life**: When choosing between two job offers, the details of the first offer might significantly influence our perception and evaluation of the second offer, even if it's objectively better. This demonstrates the Simultaneous Contrast Effect.
3. **History**: During the Cold War, the United States was often portrayed as a benevolent democracy contrasting with the communist Soviet Union. The contrast between these two ideologies heavily influenced global perceptions and allegiances, shaping foreign policies significantly (see Pioneer article which explicates the relevance of the contrast effect to foreign policies of countries).

**Application**

Understanding the Contrast Effect can help us make more informed decisions by allowing us to recognize when our perception or evaluation is being influenced by previous or surrounding stimuli. By being aware of this bias, we can counteract it by seeking additional information, considering different perspectives, and comparing apples to apples instead of apples to oranges.
