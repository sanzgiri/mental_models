# Foundation Building

 **Introduction**

"Foundation Building" is a revolutionary mental model in higher education, originating from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Founded by industrialist Peter Cooper in 1859, this model was built on the belief that an exceptional education should be accessible to all, regardless of race, religion, sex, wealth, or social status. This radical approach aimed to foster intellectual growth without financial barriers, making it a cornerstone of American education and a source of inspiration for modern educational reforms.

**Core Concept**

At its core, the Foundation Building model emphasizes the importance of equal opportunity in education. Cooper Union was designed to provide a world-class education free of charge to those who qualified, challenging the traditional elite-driven higher education system. The institution offered undergraduate and master's degree programs exclusively in architecture, fine arts, and engineering, with a shared core curriculum in humanities and social sciences. This focus on practical, vocational fields ensured that students graduated prepared for successful careers while maintaining a commitment to accessibility.

**Examples**

1. **The Cooper Union Address**: On February 27, 1860, the Great Hall of the Foundation Building became the site of Abraham Lincoln's historic address. This speech, now known as the Cooper Union Address, galvanized support for Lincoln and played a significant role in his election as President.
2. **Innovative Architecture**: The Foundation Building itself is a testament to the model's success, designed by Fred A. Petersen, one of the founders of the American Institute of Architects. It was the first structure in New York City to feature rolled-iron columns and the first academic building with an elevator.
3. **41 Cooper Square**: In 2010, a new classroom, laboratory, and studio facility replaced the aging Hewitt Academic Building at 41 Cooper Square. Designed by Thom Mayne, it was built to be environmentally friendly, showcasing the institution's commitment to sustainability and forward-thinking design.

**Financial Support**

The Foundation Building model relies on a combination of endowment, real estate investments, and community support to fund its tuition-free education program. The land under the Chrysler Building is owned by the endowment, generating significant revenue for the institution. In 2018, Tishman Speyer signed a deal with the school to pay rent, further supporting the financial stability of Cooper Union.

**Financial Crisis and Tuition Controversy**

Despite its successes, the Foundation Building model has faced financial challenges. In recent years, Cooper Union ended its free tuition policy for undergraduates but continues to offer need-based tuition remission on a sliding scale. Ongoing efforts aim to return to full-tuition scholarships for undergraduates by 2029.

In conclusion, the Foundation Building model embodies a commitment to equal opportunity in education and serves as an inspiration for modern educational reforms. By providing world-class education free of charge, it fosters intellectual growth while breaking down barriers to entry based on wealth or social status.
