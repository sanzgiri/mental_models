# Audience

 **Introduction**

The mental model of "Audience" is a fundamental concept that refers to a group of individuals who engage in various forms of art, media, or academia. Understanding the audience is crucial as it shapes the creation and consumption of content, influencing its impact and success. In today's digital age, the role of audiences has evolved significantly, with people not only consuming content but also creating and participating in it.

**Core Concept**

An audience can be divided into several types: particular (real), immediate, mediated, theoretical (imagined), self (self-deliberation), universal, ideal, and implied. Each type plays a unique role in the creation, consumption, and evaluation of content. For instance, a speaker might consider an ideal audience to formulate appeals that would resonate with their future listeners, while an implied audience is determined by the intended meaning of a text.

**Examples**

1. **The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)**: This cult classic film has become an audience-participation event where viewers interact with the movie, shout out lines, and use props during specific scenes.

2. **Blues Brothers (1980)**: The audience at regular screenings of this film in Melbourne, Australia, have been incorporated into the performance by acting as the crowd during certain scenes.

3. **British pantomimes**: These traditional performances rely heavily on audience participation, with viewers interacting with characters, calling out responses, and even participating in "ghost gags."

**Application**

Understanding the mental model of "Audience" can help creators design content that resonates with their intended audience. By considering the types of audiences, such as ideal or implied, creators can tailor their messages to be more effective and engaging. Additionally, understanding the role of audiences in various contexts, like online platforms, can help individuals leverage digital tools for creating and sharing content.
