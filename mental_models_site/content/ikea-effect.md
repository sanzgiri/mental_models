 Title: The IKEA Effect: A Cognitive Bias that Values the Fruits of Our Labor

The IKEA Effect is a fascinating mental model that explains why consumers often place an undue, disproportionate value on products they have partially created themselves. This cognitive bias, first identified and named by Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School, Daniel Mochon of Yale, and Dan Ariely of Duke in 2011, has significant implications for business, marketing, and our everyday lives.

**Core Concept**

The IKEA Effect is rooted in the human desire for effectance – the ability to successfully produce desired outcomes in one's environment. When we engage in an activity that requires effort, such as assembling furniture or crafting origami figures, our sense of competence and control increases. This increase in liking, coupled with the feelings of effectance that arise from successful completion of tasks, drives up our perceived value of the product we've created, even if it's not particularly well-made.

**Examples**

1. Business: Furniture retailer IKEA is a prime example of the IKEA Effect in action. By selling furniture that requires assembly, they tap into consumers' desire to create and own something, increasing the perceived value and thus the purchase price.
2. Life: Have you ever spent hours crafting a DIY project, only to be incredibly proud of the final result, even if it's not perfect? This is the IKEA Effect at work. The effort you put into creating something drives up your personal valuation of it.
3. History: In 1959, Aronson and Mills conducted a study where they found that women's appraisal of a group's value was proportional to the effort demanded before being allowed into the group. This early research hints at the IKEA Effect or a related phenomenon.

**Application**

Understanding the IKEA Effect can help you make more informed decisions in your daily life. Recognizing when this cognitive bias might be at play can help you avoid overvaluing self-made items and make more objective assessments of their true worth. Similarly, businesses can leverage the IKEA Effect by encouraging customers to engage in the creation or customization process of their products.

**Related Models**

1. Effort Justification: This mental model suggests that the more effort we put into something, the more we value it. It's closely related to the IKEA Effect, as both models rely on the idea that effort leads to increased valuation.
2. Sunk Cost Fallacy: The IKEA Effect is connected to this cognitive bias, which occurs when people continue to invest resources in failing projects due to the initial investment they've made. In both cases, the effort invested can lead to an irrational attachment to the outcome.
3. Not Invented Here (NIH) Syndrome: This phenomenon, where managers disregard outside solutions because they prefer in-house creations, shares some similarities with the IKEA Effect, as both involve a preference for self-created products.
