# Anchor Effect

 **The Anchor Effect: A Powerful Psychological Phenomenon**

The Anchor Effect is a fascinating mental model that delves into the intricacies of human judgment and decision-making. It highlights how our judgments or decisions can be significantly influenced by a reference point or "anchor" that may seem completely irrelevant. First described in psychophysics, this concept was formalized by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in behavioral economics.

**Core Concept**

The Anchor Effect operates on the premise of cognitive heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow us to make quick judgments under uncertainty. In the case of anchoring, our initial judgement serves as a starting point (the anchor), and subsequent judgements are adjusted from this reference point, often resulting in biased outcomes. This effect can manifest both numerically (as observed in financial decisions or estimations) and non-numerically (in physical judgments involving length, weight, and volume).

**Examples**

1. **Business**: A classic example involves car sales. If a buyer is shown an expensive car first, they are more likely to find a moderately priced car appealing since it now seems inexpensive compared to the anchor.
2. **Life**: In everyday life, your social security number can influence your bids for items if you are asked to write down the last two digits before making the bid. Those with higher numbers might bid more due to their anchored reference point.
3. **History**: The Anchor Effect was evident in stock market bubbles such as the Tulip Mania of the 17th century, where prices were driven up by a self-reinforcing cycle based on arbitrary initial valuations.

**Application**

Understanding the Anchor Effect can help you make more informed decisions by recognizing and avoiding potential biases. For instance, when negotiating a salary, understanding the anchor (a colleague's salary or an industry average) can prevent you from undervaluing your worth. Similarly, in financial decisions, being aware of initial prices can help you avoid overpaying or underestimating values.
