 Dataism: The Mental Model of the Big Data Revolution
=====================================================

In the rapidly evolving digital age, the concept of **Dataism** has emerged as a powerful and influential mental model that underscores the significance of big data in shaping our world. Coined by David Brooks in The New York Times in 2013, Dataism represents a mindset or philosophy that elevates information flow to an unprecedented level, often compared to a new form of religion.

**Core Concept**
---------------

At its core, Dataism posits that the universe is composed of data flows and that the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing (Harari, 2015). This philosophy advocates for maximizing data flow by connecting to more and more media sources, ultimately leading to a world where algorithms make critical decisions in our lives. As Yuval Noah Harari suggests, the future of humanity lies in embracing this data-driven reality, where humans serve as mere "chips" within a vast, interconnected system.

**Examples**
-------------

1. **Business and Economics**: Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook have revolutionized their industries by harnessing big data to create targeted advertisements, personalized recommendations, and predictive analytics. By leveraging user data, these companies have reshaped the economic landscape, creating new business models and challenging traditional industries (Lohr, 2016).

2. **Politics**: The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed how political leaders manipulated users' personal data to create highly specific psychological profiles and influence election outcomes (Techopedia, n.d.). This incident demonstrated the potential power of Dataism in shaping political landscapes, raising ethical concerns about privacy and consent.

3. **Art**: Albert-Laszlo Barabasi coined the term "Dataism" to describe an artistic movement that emphasizes data as a primary source of inspiration (Barabási, 2022). This movement highlights the importance of integrating scientific, business, and political methodologies in art to maintain relevance in contemporary society.

**Application**
---------------

Understanding Dataism can empower individuals to navigate the digital age more effectively. By recognizing the value placed on data flow, one can make informed decisions about their online presence, privacy settings, and consumption habits. Additionally, embracing a data-driven mindset in personal and professional decision making can lead to more accurate predictions, targeted strategies, and reduced cognitive biases.

**Related Models**
------------------

1. **Transhumanism** [`/models/transhumanism`]: Like Dataism, Transhumanism posits that technology will fundamentally alter humanity. However, while Dataism focuses on data and information, Transhumanism emphasizes the fusion of technology and biology to enhance human potential.
2. **Futurism** [`/models/futurism`]: Both Dataism and Futurism envision a world shaped by emerging technologies. While Futurism celebrates technological progress and the artistic expression of the future, Dataism offers a more pragmatic, data-driven approach to understanding and navigating this progress.
3. **Surveillance Capitalism** [`/models/surveillance-capitalism`]: A related concept, Surveillance Capitalism describes the business model where corporations collect and analyze personal data to sell targeted advertisements. Dataism and Surveillance Capitalism intersect in their shared emphasis on data collection and processing, with Dataism taking a broader, philosophical perspective.

**Criticism**
-------------

Dataism has drawn criticism for its potential dystopian implications, as well as ethical concerns around privacy and the dehumanization of individuals (Miessler, n.d.). Some argue that Dataism does not pose a significant challenge to liberal humanism because it allows humans to simultaneously believe in their own importance and that of data (Harari, 2016). Additionally, resistance to the idea of all personal data being public has already emerged as a concern.
