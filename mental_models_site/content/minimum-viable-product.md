# Minimum Viable Product

 **Introduction**

The mental model of Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a strategic approach that emphasizes the development of a product with just enough essential features to provide value and gain feedback from early customers, thereby informing future iterations. This methodology, first coined by Frank Robinson in 2001 and popularized by Steve Blank and Eric Ries, allows businesses to avoid unnecessary work and validate their assumptions about product requirements more effectively.

**Core Concept**

The MVP concept focuses on releasing a usable version of the product to early adopters, who can then provide valuable feedback for future development. By iterating on working versions based on customer input, businesses can minimize time spent on non-essential features and reduce the risk of investing in products that do not meet market demands. The MVP is a crucial component of the Lean Startup methodology and aligns with the scientific method's experimentation process when applied to validating business hypotheses ([Lean Startup](/models/lean-startup)).

**Examples**

1. **Rippa Robot**: In 2015, specialists from the University of Sydney designed Rippa, a robot for farm and weed management. The technical hypothesis – that the robot could distinguish weeds from crops – was already proven. However, the business hypothesis – whether it would be a viable tool on working farms – still needed testing through an MVP approach ([Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)).
2. **Dropbox**: Dropbox launched in 2008 with a simple video demonstrating its core functionality, allowing users to upload files and access them from any device. By doing so, they attracted over 50,000 users before releasing the actual product, providing essential feedback that informed future development ([Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox)).
3. **Airbnb**: Airbnb initially launched as Airbedandbreakfast.com in 2008 with three user-submitted listings for guests to book in San Francisco. This MVP approach allowed the company to test its market potential and gather valuable feedback before scaling up ([Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb)).

**Application**

Readers can apply the MVP concept in their daily lives by adopting an iterative, customer-focused approach when developing new products or solutions. By identifying essential features and releasing early versions to gather feedback, they can minimize waste, reduce risk, and optimize their offerings based on market demand.
