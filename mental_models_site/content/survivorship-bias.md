 Title: Survivorship Bias: A Mental Model that Shapes Decision Making

In the realm of cognitive biases, one model stands out for its profound impact on decision-making and analysis – the Survivorship Bias. This mental model, as simple as it may seem, can significantly skew our understanding of success rates, performance, and the likelihood of specific events or outcomes.

**Introduction**

Survivorship bias is a logical fallacy that occurs when we concentrate on entities that have survived a selection process while ignoring those that did not. This oversight can lead to incorrect conclusions due to incomplete data, creating an illusion of success where failure may be prevalent. In today's world, where data-driven decision making has become the norm, understanding survivorship bias is crucial for making informed decisions and avoiding costly mistakes.

**Core Concept**

The mechanism behind survivorship bias lies in the exclusion of failed or unsuccessful entities from analysis due to their absence or non-existence. This exclusion leads to a skewed perception that only successful outcomes are possible, disregarding the countless instances of failure that were omitted from the dataset. A classic example illustrating this concept is the case of parapsychology researcher Joseph Banks Rhine, who erroneously concluded that some individuals had extra-sensory perception (ESP) due to a survivorship bias in his subject selection process.

**Examples**

1. **Finance and Economics**: Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs about investment performance when failed companies are excluded from studies, making the results skew higher than the actual market average.

2. **Business**: The success stories that permeate popular media often overlook the countless individuals who have failed despite being equally skilled and determined due to factors beyond their control or other seemingly random events.

3. **History**: Historians tend to study organizations that are still in existence more than those that have closed, leading to an imbalanced understanding of historical developments.

**Application**

In your daily life, recognizing survivorship bias can help you make more informed decisions and avoid falling victim to the illusion of success. When analyzing data or evaluating success rates, always consider whether any failures were excluded from the dataset, and if so, attempt to account for their absence to obtain a more accurate picture.

**Related Models**

1. **Confirmation Bias**: This cognitive bias refers to the tendency to seek out information that confirms one's existing beliefs while disregarding or ignoring contradictory evidence. Survivorship bias and confirmation bias are closely related, as both can lead to incorrect conclusions based on incomplete data.

2. **Selection Bias**: Similar to survivorship bias, selection bias refers to the distortion of research findings due to the way subjects are selected for a study or experiment. While selection bias encompasses various types of biases, including survivorship bias, it is a broader concept that includes other forms of sampling errors.
