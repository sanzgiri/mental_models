# Planning Fallacy

 **Introduction**

The Planning Fallacy is a cognitive bias that manifests as an unrealistic optimism when estimating the time, cost, and resources required to complete future tasks or projects. First proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979, this mental model matters significantly as it often leads to project delays, cost overruns, and dissatisfaction with outcomes.

**Core Concept**

The Planning Fallacy arises from an individual's tendency to focus on the most optimistic scenario for a task while underestimating the time and resources needed based on past experiences. This bias is evident even when individuals recognize that their previous predictions have been over-optimistic. The bias not only affects time estimates but also extends to cost and benefit projections, leading to potential project failure.

**Examples**

1. **Sydney Opera House**: Initially expected to be completed in 1963, the Sydney Opera House opened a decade later with an estimated cost of $102 million, compared to the original budget of $7 million.

2. **The Big Dig (Boston Central Artery)**: Scheduled for completion in 1998, The Big Dig was finished seven years later and cost $8.08 billion on a budget of $2.8 billion (in 1988 dollars).

3. **Berlin Brandenburg Airport**: Originally planned to open in October 2011, the airport finally opened on October 31, 2020, with current projections close to €10.0 billion, up from the original budget of €2.83 billion.

**Application**

Recognizing and addressing the Planning Fallacy can help individuals and organizations make more accurate predictions about project timelines, costs, and benefits. To apply this mental model in daily life:

1. Analyze past projects to identify common pitfalls and overestimations.
2. Incorporate contingencies into project plans to account for unexpected delays or issues.
3. Seek feedback from others with similar experiences to help refine estimates.
4. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks to better estimate overall time and resources needed.

**Related Models**

1. **Hofstadter's Law**: An adage referring to the increasing complexity and time required for tasks as they grow in size and scope.
2. **Parkinson's Law**: The adage that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion.

By understanding these related mental models, individuals can further improve their project planning and estimation skills.
