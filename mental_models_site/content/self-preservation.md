# Self-Preservation

 Title: The Mental Model of Self-Preservation: A Comprehensive Overview

Self-Preservation is a fundamental mental model that drives individuals and groups alike, prioritizing survival, safety, and protection of one's own interests above all else. It plays a crucial role in decision-making processes, shaping actions and responses to various situations, particularly in stressful or threatening scenarios. In the contemporary context, this model is vividly portrayed in the television series The Boys, based on the comic book series by Garth Ennis.

**Introduction**

The mental model of Self-Preservation can be seen in action throughout The Boys, a show set in a universe where superpowered individuals, known as Supes, are portrayed as corrupt and power-hungry instead of the heroes the public believes them to be. As the series unfolds, characters make decisions based on their need for self-preservation, often leading to complex moral dilemmas and conflicts.

**Core Concept**

In The Boys, self-preservation is demonstrated through various character arcs that revolve around personal survival, protection of loved ones, and the pursuit of power and control. Characters such as Billy Butcher and Homelander are driven by their need to protect themselves and those they care about, while also seeking to maintain or gain power over others.

**Examples**

1. **Billy Butcher**: After his wife Becca is raped by Homelander, Butcher becomes obsessed with taking revenge and destroying Vought and the Supes. His self-preservation instincts drive him to form The Boys, a group of vigilantes dedicated to exposing the corrupt nature of the Supes and bringing them down.
2. **Homelander**: As the most powerful Supe and the face of Vought, Homelander is driven by his need for power and control. When he discovers The Boys, his self-preservation instincts are triggered, leading him to investigate their identities and take action against them to protect his position.
3. **The Deep**: Initially portrayed as a shallow and selfish Supe, The Deep's character arc is significantly shaped by his need for self-preservation. After being exposed by The Boys and losing his career and reputation, he becomes desperate to regain his power and status, leading him to make increasingly dangerous and unethical decisions.

**Conclusion**

In The Boys, the mental model of Self-Preservation serves as a central theme that drives various character arcs and conflicts throughout the series. Characters are motivated by their need for survival, protection of loved ones, and the pursuit of power, creating a complex web of relationships, alliances, and betrayals. This exploration of self-preservation provides a thought-provoking commentary on human nature and our instinctual drive to protect ourselves in the face of danger or threat.
