# Hawthorne Effect

 **The Hawthorne Effect: A Phenomenon that Shapes Human Behavior in Response to Observation**

The Hawthorne Effect, a fascinating mental model discovered in the 1920s, refers to individuals modifying their behavior due to awareness of being observed. This phenomenon, initially identified during research conducted at the Hawthorne Works factory in Illinois, has significant implications for understanding human behavior and decision-making in various contexts.

**Core Concept**

The Hawthorne Effect revolves around the idea that people tend to perform better when they believe they are being observed or appreciated. The original studies suggested that this heightened performance was not due to changes in lighting, as initially hypothesized, but rather a response to increased attention and interest from researchers. This phenomenon can manifest in various ways, such as improved productivity, altered behavior, or enhanced motivation.

**Examples**

1. **Business**: In the initial experiments at the Hawthorne Works factory, workers' productivity increased during periods of observation, even when conditions were changed back to their original state. This demonstrated the powerful impact of attention and interest on employee performance.

2. **Life**: A modern-day example can be found in classrooms, where students may work harder or pay more attention if they believe they are being observed by teachers or peers. This effect emphasizes the importance of creating an engaging learning environment for optimal academic achievement.

3. **History**: During the Cold War, both the United States and Soviet Union embarked on a series of space races. Astronauts from each side were subject to intense media scrutiny, which likely contributed to their exceptional performance and perseverance despite challenging circumstances. This example illustrates how the Hawthorne Effect can drive outstanding achievements in high-pressure situations.

**Application**

Understanding the Hawthorne Effect can help individuals and organizations make more informed decisions by recognizing the potential influence of observation on behavior. By leveraging this mental model, leaders can foster a supportive environment that encourages increased productivity, motivation, and engagement among team members.

2. **[Pygmalion Effect](/models/pygmalion-effect)**: Also known as the Rosenthal effect, this model demonstrates how high expectations from supervisors or teachers can positively impact the performance of subordinates or students.
