# First Principles

 Title: First Principles: The Foundation of Reasoning and Decision Making

The mental model known as "First Principles" is a powerful tool for breaking down complex problems into their fundamental components, enabling us to reason more effectively and make well-informed decisions. This ancient concept, tracing its roots back to the philosophies of Aristotle and the Pre-Socratic philosophers, continues to be relevant in modern science, mathematics, and everyday life.

**Core Concept**

First Principles revolve around basic assumptions or axioms that serve as the foundation for reasoning and knowledge construction. In the realm of philosophy, these principles are often called "a priori terms" and contrasted with "a posteriori terms," which are deduced through experience or observation. In formal logic, they are equivalent to axioms or postulates in mathematical systems. In physics and other sciences, working from first principles means starting directly at the level of established science without making assumptions based on empirical models or parameter fitting.

**Examples**

1. **Mathematics**: The Euclid's Elements serve as a classic example of the application of First Principles. Euclid's geometric propositions are derived from a set of definitions, postulates, and primitive notions—all of which constitute first principles.

2. **Physics**: The Schrödinger equation is an ab initio approach in quantum mechanics used to calculate the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and other physical systems. It starts directly from the established laws of physics without making assumptions such as empirical model and fitting parameters.

3. **History**: In ancient Greece, philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes sought to explain the world using a single unifying element—water, apeiron (indefinite substance), and air, respectively. By starting from these basic assumptions, they offered explanations of the physical world without relying on supernatural forces.

**Application**

Applying First Principles in daily life can help you make better decisions by encouraging critical thinking and breaking down complex problems into their fundamental components. To utilize this mental model:

1. Identify the problem or question at hand.
2. Break it down to its most basic components—the first principles or axioms in your specific domain of interest (e.g., mathematics, physics, philosophy).
3. Assess which first principles are relevant to the question and make sure your conclusions do not violate any fundamental laws or assumptions.
4. Cross-reference your conclusions based on chosen axioms to ensure consistency.
5. Iterate and refine your understanding as needed.

**Related Models**

1. **First Causes**: This mental model deals with the origins of things, tracing causes back to their ultimate source or reason for existence. It is closely related to First Principles, as both models focus on identifying foundational assumptions and principles.

2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential characteristics while omitting unnecessary details. This mental model complements First Principles by allowing us to work with more manageable representations of reality based on fundamental axioms.
