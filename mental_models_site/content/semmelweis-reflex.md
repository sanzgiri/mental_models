 Title: The Semmelweis Reflex: A Mental Model for Resisting Change and Embracing New Knowledge

The Semmelweis Reflex, named after Ignaz Semmelweis – a Hungarian physician who pioneered the concept of hand hygiene in the 19th century – is a mental model that encapsulates our innate tendency to reject new evidence or ideas that contradict established norms, beliefs, or paradigms. This mental model matters because understanding it can help us navigate various aspects of life and decision-making by fostering critical thinking and openness towards novel concepts.

**Core Concept**

The Semmelweis Reflex operates as a cognitive bias that leads individuals to favor information consistent with their prior beliefs or values, as well as an overreliance on authority figures, belief perseverance, groupthink, and theory-induced blindness. In the case of Semmelweis, his groundbreaking handwashing proposal was met with resistance due to existing beliefs about disease transmission (miasma theory) and the influence of authority figures within the medical community.

**Examples**

1. **Covid-19 Transmission**: The delayed recognition of COVID-19's airborne transmission by the World Health Organization exemplifies the Semmelweis Reflex, as it took months for the WHO to acknowledge aerosol spread despite some initial evidence.
2. **Resistance to Plant-Based Diets**: Despite scientific consensus that well-planned plant-based diets can meet human nutritional needs across all life stages, resistance persists due to cultural and emotional attachments to meat consumption, particularly in regions where it forms a central part of traditional identity or masculinity.
3. **Climate Change Skepticism**: The refusal by some individuals and corporations to accept the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change highlights the Semmelweis Reflex, as acceptance of this theory requires challenging established norms related to economic growth and energy consumption.

**Application**

Recognizing the Semmelweis Reflex can help us identify our biases and make more informed decisions. To combat it, one should critically evaluate beliefs taken for granted, engage in deliberate reflection, and actively consider alternative viewpoints. This requires the engagement of System 2 thinking – a conscious, logical, and analytical mode of thought that contrasts with the intuitive and automatic System 1 thinking we often rely on.
