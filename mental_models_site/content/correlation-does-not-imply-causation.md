# Correlation does not imply causation

 **Title: Correlation Does Not Imply Causation: A Crucial Mental Model for Decision Making**

**Introduction**

The mental model "Correlation does not imply causation" is a fundamental principle in statistics, logic, and critical thinking. It emphasizes the importance of understanding that a observed association or correlation between two events or variables does not necessarily mean one event causes the other. This principle is crucial for avoiding logical fallacies and making informed decisions.

**Core Concept**

The idea that "correlation implies causation" is a form of questionable cause, also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc or post hoc ergo propter hoc. It occurs when two events are observed together and a causal relationship is incorrectly inferred. To establish causality, additional evidence such as controlled experiments, time series analysis, or the application of statistical methods like Granger causality test and convergent cross mapping are required.

**Examples**

1. **Windmills and Wind**: A classic example is the relationship between windmills and wind velocity. While it appears that faster-rotating windmills produce more wind, the reality is that wind causes windmills to rotate, not vice versa.

2. **Low Cholesterol and Mortality**: Another instance can be found in medicine, where a low cholesterol level was initially believed to reduce mortality risk. However, this correlation is reversed since certain diseases such as cancer and cirrhosis of the liver cause both low cholesterol and increased mortality rates.

3. **TV Violence and Child Behavior**: In social sciences, a study might find that children who watch a lot of TV are more violent. However, this correlation could also indicate that violent children prefer watching more TV than their less violent counterparts.

**Application**

In daily life, understanding the concept of correlation not implying causation helps individuals avoid jumping to conclusions based on seemingly obvious relationships between events or variables. It encourages a critical approach to information and promotes evidence-based decision making.
