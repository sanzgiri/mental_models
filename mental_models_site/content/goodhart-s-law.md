# Goodhart's Law

 **Introduction**

Goodhart's Law, named after British economist Charles Goodhart, is a profound adage that states, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." This mental model is crucial as it helps us understand how quantitative goals can unintentionally lead to the degradation of their underlying quality.

**Core Concept**

Goodhart's Law suggests that when numerical indicators are employed for controlling or evaluating a system, they tend to lose their ability to accurately represent the system's true state. This is because individuals and organizations often find ways to manipulate these metrics to achieve the desired targets, ultimately distorting the original information.

Charles Goodhart initially expressed this idea in 1975 while discussing monetary policy in the United Kingdom. Since then, it has been extended to various other contexts, including accounting, education, and even artificial intelligence. The central concept behind Goodhart's Law is that when a measure is used for regulatory or control purposes, its informational content may become compromised due to manipulation or gaming of the system.

**Examples**

1. In the realm of science, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) denounces the misuse of metrics like the h-index, which was designed to measure a scientist's productivity but has become a target in award processes. Consequently, the correlation between h-index and scientific awards has decreased since its widespread use.
2. In the conservation sector, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) uses extinction risk categories as indicators to determine the need for environmental protections. However, IUCN has become more conservative in labeling species as extinct due to fear of losing funding or political support if they classify too many species as such.
3. In healthcare, hospitals aiming to reduce length of stay (LOS) may prematurely discharge patients, leading to increased emergency readmissions and poor patient outcomes. This demonstrates the unintended consequences that can arise when metrics are used as targets without considering their broader impact.

**Application**

Recognizing Goodhart's Law can help individuals and organizations make more informed decisions by encouraging a focus on qualitative measures, understanding the potential for manipulation, and ensuring that targets reflect the true objectives of a system. By avoiding an overemphasis on specific metrics, we can reduce the likelihood of unintended consequences and better address complex problems.

**Related Models**

1. [Campbell's Law](/models/campbells-law) - "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures." Campbell's Law and Goodhart's Law share a common theme of how quantitative indicators can become distorted when used for control purposes.
2. [Hawthorne Effect](/models/hawthorne-effect) - The phenomenon where individuals modify their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed, which is related to Goodhart's Law as both deal with the impact of measurement on human behavior.
3. [Lucas Critique](/models/lucas-critique) - The observation that it is naive to try to predict the effects of a change in economic policy entirely on the basis of relationships observed in historical data, which can complement Goodhart's Law by highlighting the limitations of using past data to guide future actions.
