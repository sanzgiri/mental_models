 Critical Thinking: A Mental Model for Rational Decision Making
==============================================================

**Introduction**

Critical thinking is a mental model that enables individuals to analyze facts, evidence, and arguments in a rational, skeptical, and unbiased manner. It is a process of active and skillful evaluation that guides our beliefs and actions by providing justifications, comparing perspectives, and assessing the potential consequences. This essential skill has been traced back to the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, who encouraged questioning and evidence-based reasoning as a means of understanding the world around us [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking).

**Core Concept**

At its core, critical thinking involves several key components:

1. **Recognizing underlying assumptions**: Critical thinkers identify and challenge the hidden beliefs that influence their own thoughts and those of others.
2. **Providing justifications for ideas and actions**: Critical thinkers articulate reasons and evidence for their beliefs and decisions, making them accountable for their choices.
3. **Evaluating these justifications through comparisons with varying perspectives**: Critical thinkers consider alternative viewpoints and critically examine the strength of arguments from different angles.
4. **Assessing rationality and potential consequences**: Critical thinkers weigh the merits of various arguments, taking into account their logical consistency, relevance, and implications for the real world.

**Examples**

1. Business Decisions: In a business setting, critical thinking can help leaders make informed decisions by evaluating multiple options, considering potential risks and benefits, and basing choices on evidence rather than gut feelings [Source](https://hbr.org/2017/03/critical-thinking-is-the-most-important-skill-you-didnt-learn-in-school).
2. Historical Events: Critical thinking played a crucial role in the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, as activists used evidence, logic, and rational argumentation to challenge entrenched racial prejudice and advocate for equal rights [Source](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanexperience/features/civil-rights-movement-critical-thinking/).
3. Personal Decision Making: When faced with a difficult personal decision, critical thinking can help individuals evaluate their options, weigh the pros and cons, and make rational choices based on evidence rather than emotions [Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-shame/201603/how-critical-thinking-can-help-you-make-better-decisions).
