# Black and White Thinking

 Black and White Thinking (also known as Splitting or Dichotomous Thinking) is a mental model that refers to an individual's tendency to categorize people, ideas, and things into either good or bad without considering the nuances and complexities that exist in reality. This mental model matters because it can lead to inflexible thinking patterns, impaired decision-making, and unstable relationships.

**Core Concept**

Black and White Thinking is a defense mechanism that helps individuals cope with uncomfortable emotions or situations by simplifying them into either positive or negative categories. It often stems from childhood development but is expected to recede as the individual matures and learns to understand that people possess both good and bad qualities simultaneously.

Individuals who engage in Black and White Thinking may perceive contradictions as rejections, attempts to isolate or abandon them, or unwanted attraction. They tend to idealize or devalue others based on their own needs and feelings, and they struggle to integrate positive and negative aspects of themselves and others. This can lead to mood swings, unstable relationships, and impaired interpersonal functioning.

**Examples**

1. Business: A CEO may view employees as either competent or incompetent, leading to a lack of nuanced feedback and potential burnout among employees who are consistently devalued.
2. History: The Cold War era was characterized by extreme polarization between the United States and the Soviet Union, with each side viewing the other as an enemy that threatened global peace and democracy.
3. Personal Life: An individual may idealize their romantic partner during the honeymoon phase but quickly devalue them when faced with disagreements or conflicts, leading to unstable relationships and difficulty resolving issues amicably.

**Application**

Becoming aware of Black and White Thinking is the first step towards managing it. To apply this mental model in daily life, individuals can practice recognizing when they are thinking in extremes and challenge themselves to consider the complexities and nuances that exist within people, ideas, and situations. This can help promote more flexible and adaptive thinking patterns.
