# First Principles Thinking

 **Introduction**

First Principles Thinking is a mental model that encourages breaking down complex problems or concepts into their most fundamental and irreducible parts, known as first principles. This approach, rooted in ancient Greek philosophy, has gained prominence in various fields, from physics to business strategy, due to its potential for innovation and problem-solving. By challenging assumptions and questioning the underlying foundations of a problem, First Principles Thinking fosters a deep understanding that can lead to unconventional solutions.

**Core Concept**

First principles are basic, self-evident truths or axioms that serve as the foundation for reasoning in a particular field. In philosophy, these principles are often considered prior to any empirical evidence or logical deduction, existing independently of and preceding the reasoning process (a priori). In mathematics and formal logic, first principles are referred to as axioms or postulates – statements that are accepted without proof within a given system.

First Principles Thinking involves decomposing complex problems into their basic components, questioning established knowledge, and rebuilding an understanding based on the most fundamental first principles. This process encourages a deep, foundational understanding of the problem at hand and can lead to innovative solutions that challenge conventional wisdom.

**Examples**

1. **Business Strategy:** Elon Musk is known for using First Principles Thinking in his business ventures. When faced with the challenge of reducing the cost of electric batteries, he did not start by investigating existing battery technologies. Instead, he questioned the fundamentals: what is a battery, and what are its essential components? By breaking down the problem to its core principles, Musk was able to develop a new approach to battery technology that drastically reduced costs (Source: Wait But Why).
2. **Physics:** Theoretical physicists often use First Principles Thinking in their work. For instance, when trying to understand the behavior of particles at the quantum level, they start with the established laws of physics and work from first principles, rather than relying on empirical models and parameter fitting (Source: Wikipedia).
3. **History:** Ancient Greek philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes used First Principles Thinking to explain the physical world without reference to the supernatural. By questioning the underlying principles of existence, they opened the way for modern science (Source: Wikipedia).

**Application**

Applying First Principles Thinking in daily life involves challenging assumptions, questioning established knowledge, and breaking down complex problems to their most fundamental components. This approach encourages a deep understanding of problems, fosters creativity, and can lead to innovative solutions. To practice First Principles Thinking:

1. Identify the problem or concept you want to understand better.
2. Break it down into its most basic components (first principles).
3. Question these first principles and challenge any assumptions.
4. Reassemble your understanding based on the newly questioned first principles.
5. Evaluate the solutions or conclusions drawn from this newfound understanding.

**Related Models**

1. **Black Swan Thinking:** This mental model emphasizes the importance of focusing on rare, unpredictable events that have a significant impact (Source: TED).
2. **Inversion Thinking:** Inverting problems – turning them upside-down to question their opposite – is a related approach that can help identify the roots of problems and generate innovative solutions (Source: Farnam Street).
3. **Systems Thinking:** This mental model encourages viewing complex problems as interconnected systems, emphasizing the importance of understanding how different parts interact with one another (Source: Harvard Business Review).
