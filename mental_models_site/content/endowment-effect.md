 **The Endowment Effect: Understanding the Psychology Behind Our Possessions**

The mental model of "Endowment Effect" is a crucial concept in psychology and behavioral economics that explains why people tend to place a higher value on objects they own compared to those they don't. This phenomenon, often referred to as divestiture aversion, challenges the traditional economic theory that people are rational decision-makers when it comes to acquiring or parting with goods.

**Core Concept**

The Endowment Effect is primarily associated with loss aversion, where individuals subjectively value something more when they stand to lose it rather than gain an equivalent benefit. This bias can be observed in the gap between people's maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for an object and their least acceptable amount to part with it (WTA), even when there is no emotional attachment or the item has been acquired recently. The Endowment Effect can also be attributed to psychological inertia, where both buyers and sellers often lack a well-defined valuation for an object, leading them to maintain the status quo out of inertia.

**Examples**

1. One of the most famous examples is the study by Kahneman, Knetsch & Thaler (1990), where Cornell University undergraduates were given a mug and then offered to sell or trade it. They found that participants required approximately twice as much compensation to give up their mug compared to what they would pay to acquire an equally valuable pen.
2. In another study by Ziv Carmon & Dan Ariely, participants' hypothetical selling price for NCAA final four tournament tickets was 14 times higher than their buying price.
3. Hossain and List (Working Paper) showed that workers worked harder to maintain ownership of a provisionally awarded bonus compared to when the bonus was framed as yet-to-be-awarded.

**Application**

Understanding the Endowment Effect can help individuals make more informed decisions by encouraging them to consider their potential loss and the psychological value they associate with their possessions. This knowledge can lead to fairer negotiations, better financial management, and reduced emotional attachment to material goods.

**Neoclassical Explanations**

Neoclassical economists argue that the Endowment Effect can be explained through differences in individual utility functions and wealth effects. These theories suggest that the value individuals place on an object depends on their personal taste and wealth, which may differ between buyers and sellers.

**Connection-based Theories**

Connection-based theories propose that the Endowment Effect arises from the emotional attachment or association with the self induced by owning a good. As individuals form connections with their possessions, they perceive potential losses as threats to their identity, leading them to overvalue their belongings.

**Greater Sensitivity to Market Demands for Sellers**

Sellers may be more sensitive to market demands due to considering multiple potential buyers and their diverse tastes. This sensitivity can lead sellers to dictate a price based on the market's preferences, resulting in higher selling prices compared to individual taste estimates.

**Biased Information Processing Theories**

Certain cognitive theories suggest that the Endowment Effect is induced by biased information processing associated with acquisition or dispossession of goods. Frames evoked by acquiring a good (e.g., buying) may increase the accessibility of information favoring the decision to keep one's money, while frames related to disposing of a good may make it easier for individuals to justify keeping the object rather than parting with it.

By understanding these various explanations and factors influencing the Endowment Effect, we can gain insights into human decision-making and develop strategies to mitigate its impacts on our lives.
