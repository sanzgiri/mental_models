# Categorical Imperative

 **Introduction**

The Categorical Imperative (German: Kategorischer Imperativ) is a central concept in Immanuel Kant's deontological moral philosophy, introduced in his 1785 work "Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals." This mental model serves as a means to evaluate motivations for actions and sets an ultimate commandment of reason that governs all duties and obligations. It stands out due to its emphasis on universal law and moral autonomy, offering a unique perspective on ethics that contrasts with popular moral philosophies of Kant's time.

**Core Concept**

Kant proposed that pure practical reason underlies our decision-making process regarding what is moral. Distinct from mere practical reason, which determines actions within the physical world, and pure reason, which is the capacity to know without being shown, pure practical reason dictates moral action independent of subjective considerations such as personal desires or feelings.

Hypothetical imperatives guide us on choosing means to achieve our ends but do not determine what those ends should be. Kant considered right actions prior to good ones and argued that judgments about morality must be reached a priori, using pure practical reason independently of observed motivations and inclinations.

The Categorical Imperative introduces an unconditional requirement for action, commanding immediate adherence to maxims that meet its universal requirements. These maxims must not only be obeyed but also justified as ends in themselves, possessing intrinsic value beyond simple desirability.

**Examples**

1. Business Ethics: Consider a corporation that prioritizes short-term profits over environmental sustainability. Applying the Categorical Imperative would suggest that if this practice were to become universal law, it could result in irreversible damage to the planet, making it an unethical action according to Kant's principles.
2. Personal Life: Suppose a person decides to lie to protect their own interests, disregarding the truth and deceiving others. If this were a universal law, trust would be eroded, making it impossible for people to live together in honesty and mutual respect – an unethical consequence according to Kant's universalizability test.
3. Political Decisions: In politics, leaders may be tempted to exploit or oppress certain groups for their own gain. If such behavior became a universal law, it would infringe on the autonomy of individuals and deny their status as ends in themselves, making it an immoral action according to Kant's second formulation of the Categorical Imperative.
