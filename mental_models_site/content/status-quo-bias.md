# Status Quo Bias

 Title: Understanding the Mental Model of Status Quo Bias: A Preference for the Current State of Affairs

The **Status Quo Bias** is a powerful cognitive phenomenon that refers to an individual's preference for maintaining their existing state of affairs, often viewed as the baseline or default. This mental model is crucial because it significantly influences decision-making processes across various domains, from economics and health to ethics and personal life choices.

## Core Concept

The Status Quo Bias operates by evaluating changes from the current baseline positively and perceiving them as gains or losses. The bias is not necessarily irrational, as it can result from a rational preference for the status quo when the existing state is more beneficial than available alternatives or when information is imperfect. However, research shows that the bias frequently affects human decision-making [1].

The Status Quo Bias intersects with other cognitive processes such as loss aversion, endowment effect, longevity, mere exposure, and regret avoidance [2]. Loss aversion, for instance, contributes to the bias by making individuals weigh potential losses of switching from the status quo more heavily than potential gains.

## Examples

1. **Economic Decisions**: Kahneman, Thaler, and Knetsch (1991) conducted experiments demonstrating the endowment effect, loss aversion, and Status Quo Bias in people's willingness to trade goods [3].
2. **Organ Donations**: Fevrier & Gay (2004) studied Status Quo Bias in organ donation consent, finding that individuals were more likely to maintain the status quo [2].
3. **Retirement Plans**: Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) demonstrated the Status Quo Bias through questionnaires, showing that subjects tended to remain with the default option when offered [2].
4. **Automotive Insurance**: The US states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania inadvertently ran a real-life experiment on Status Quo Bias in the early 1990s regarding car insurance choices [2].
5. **Healthcare Choices**: Boonen, Donkers, and Schut (2006) conducted discrete choice experiments investigating consumers' preferences for general practitioners and their reluctance to switch despite financial incentives [4].

## Application

Recognizing and addressing the Status Quo Bias can help individuals make more informed decisions. For instance, when evaluating new opportunities or options, it's essential to consider whether the potential gains outweigh the perceived losses of changing from the current state. Additionally, understanding this bias can help in setting defaults that nudge people towards preferred choices [2].

## Related Models

1. **Loss Aversion**: This mental model explains why individuals tend to avoid losses more than pursuing equivalent gains [5].
2. **Endowment Effect**: This cognitive bias causes individuals to overvalue things they possess and undervalue identical objects they do not have [6].

In conclusion, understanding the Status Quo Bias is crucial for navigating various decisions effectively. By being aware of this mental model's influence, individuals can make more informed choices that consider both potential gains and losses.
