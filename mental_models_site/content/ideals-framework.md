# IDEALS Framework

 **Introduction**

IDEAL (Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study) is a groundbreaking framework designed to improve the quality of research in surgery and interventional procedures. This innovative model, developed through a series of expert consensus meetings at Balliol College, Oxford, between 2007 and 2009, aims to address unique challenges in establishing optimal evidence bases for surgical innovations. By emphasizing appropriate methods, transparency, and rigorous reporting, IDEAL seeks to revolutionize the field by promoting evidence-based practice tailored specifically to surgery and interventional procedures.

**Core Concept**

The IDEAL framework comprises five stages, each with specific recommendations to guide researchers through the process of innovating and validating new surgical procedures:

1. **Idea**: Report all new procedures automatically in an online registry and include details about adverse events.
2. **Development**: Establish prospective development studies with predefined outcomes, avoid retrospective case series, and use a reporting template like STROBE for any exceptions.
3. **Exploration**: Use validated methods to evaluate learning curves (such as CUSUM) in a prospective research database, and focus on disease-based rather than procedure-specific outcomes.
4. **Assessment**: Employ randomized controlled trials or acceptable alternatives to assess the effectiveness of the new procedure.
5. **Long-term study**: Report only key outcomes and relevant information, adjusting for patient comorbidities and surgeon learning curves when comparing outcomes among different surgeons or institutions.

**Examples**

1. **Minimally Invasive Surgery**: The IDEAL framework has been instrumental in the development and validation of minimally invasive surgery techniques, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy. By following the recommendations set out by IDEAL, researchers have been able to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these procedures, ensuring they are both effective and safe for patients.
2. **Spinal Fusion**: The application of the IDEAL framework has also been beneficial in the assessment of spinal fusion procedures. By following the stages outlined by IDEAL, researchers have been able to compare outcomes among different surgeons and institutions, providing valuable insights into best practices and patient outcomes.
3. **Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD)**: The IDEAL framework has extended its reach beyond traditional surgery, with applications in the evaluation of medical devices such as the Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD). In 2011, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration held a public workshop to discuss using IDEAL to develop high-quality evidence for devices and implants like ICDs.

**Application**

The IDEAL framework offers valuable insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers involved in surgical innovation. By adhering to the recommendations outlined in each stage, practitioners can ensure their research is rigorous, transparent, and aligned with evidence-based practice. This can lead to improved patient outcomes, more effective procedures, and a higher standard of care across the field of surgery.

**Related Models**

1. **CIPP (Clinical Problem, Intervention, Patient Outcome, Process)**: A mental model that focuses on defining clinical problems, identifying interventions to address those problems, evaluating their impact on patient outcomes, and documenting the process used in their implementation.
2. **Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework**: This model emphasizes the importance of translating research findings into actionable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and patients. It consists of three stages: Knowledge Creation, Knowledge Transfer, and Knowledge Uptake & Application.
3. **Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)**: A comprehensive model that identifies 14 key domains influencing behavior change, such as knowledge, skills, social/professional role, and beliefs about consequences. It can be used to design interventions aimed at promoting evidence-based practice in various healthcare contexts.
