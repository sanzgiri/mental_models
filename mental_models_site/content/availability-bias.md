 **The Mental Model of Availability Bias: A Powerful yet Misleading Shortcut**

The mental model of Availability Bias is a cognitive heuristic that relies on the immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating specific topics, concepts, or decisions. This heuristic, first studied by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the late 1960s and early 1970s, operates on the notion that if something can be quickly recalled, it is perceived as more important or frequent.

**Core Concept**

The Availability Bias works by relying on the ease with which information comes to mind. It assumes that the likelihood of an event is directly proportional to its ease of recall. This heuristic is biased towards recently acquired information and can lead to systematic errors in judgment due to its focus on immediate examples rather than comprehensive data.

**Examples**

1. **Business Decisions**: Companies may base their strategies on recent trends or incidents that are easily recalled, overlooking more significant but less sensational factors. For instance, a company might invest heavily in a product category because of a recent success story, disregarding the long-term market trends.

2. **Public Perception of Risks**: Media coverage can significantly influence public perception of risks by focusing on unusual and sensational events over common occurrences. For example, people may perceive shark attacks as more dangerous than airplane crashes, despite the latter causing far more deaths.

3. **Legal Judgments**: In courtrooms, judges and juries may rely on the Availability Bias when making decisions. Witness testimonies that are easily recalled or emotionally impactful might carry more weight than less dramatic but factually accurate evidence.

**Application**

To avoid falling prey to the Availability Bias, it is essential to consciously seek out and consider a wide range of information before making decisions. This includes not only recent events but also historical data and less sensational factors that might be overlooked.
