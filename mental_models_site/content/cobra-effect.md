# Cobra Effect

 **Introduction**

The Cobra Effect is an economic concept that revolves around perverse incentives, where well-intentioned interventions inadvertently create unintended and counterproductive outcomes. This mental model holds significance as it serves as a reminder of the importance of thoroughly considering the potential consequences of our actions before implementing policies or initiatives.

**Core Concept**

The Cobra Effect is named after an anecdote from British Raj, wherein a bounty on dead cobras led to an increase in the population due to people breeding the snakes for the reward and later releasing them when the program was discontinued. The core theory behind it is that incentives can sometimes have unanticipated consequences, where individuals may manipulate systems to their advantage, leading to adverse effects on the intended objectives.

**Examples**

1. **Electoral Systems**: In single transferable vote systems, a candidate could potentially lose elections due to voters strategically voting for less favored candidates to prevent a preferred one from winning (also known as tactical voting).

2. **Promotional Schemes and Public Relations**: Hacktoberfest, an annual celebration promoting contributions to open-source software communities, faced issues when free T-shirts led to frivolous pull requests on projects.

3. **Humanitarian and Welfare Policies**: The Safe Third Country Agreement between Canada and the U.S., intended to discourage asylum shopping, instead led to an increase in illegal border crossings and a surge of asylum applications.

4. **Literature**: Mark Twain's autobiography recounts his wife paying for killed flies, which resulted in people breaking up whole skulls into smaller pieces to maximize their payments.
