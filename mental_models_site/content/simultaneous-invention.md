# Simultaneous Invention

 **Title: Simultaneous Invention - A Mental Model for Understanding Innovation and Discovery**

Simultaneous Invention, also known as multiple discovery, is a mental model that posits that most scientific discoveries and inventions are made independently and almost simultaneously by multiple scientists and inventors. This model challenges the traditional "heroic theory" of invention and discovery, which often focuses on individual genius and sole credit for groundbreaking achievements.

**Core Concept**

The concept of simultaneous invention is based on the observation that many scientific discoveries and inventions have been made independently by multiple individuals. This phenomenon is similar to convergent evolution in biology, where organisms evolve similar traits in response to similar environmental pressures. In science and technology, recombinant conceptualization plays a significant role in facilitating simultaneous invention. The evolution of means of communication—such as roads, printing, telegraphy, and the internet—have catalyzed and accelerated this process by enabling researchers to share ideas and build upon each other's work more efficiently.

**Examples**

1. **Mathematics**: The development of calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century is a classic example of simultaneous invention. Despite exchanging information on their respective systems, both scientists developed calculus independently.

2. **Physics**: The theory of evolution of species was independently advanced by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the 19th century. Upon receiving Wallace's theory, Darwin presented a joint paper with Wallace to the Linnean Society in 1858, demonstrating the occurrence of simultaneous discovery.

3. **Inventions**: The blast furnace, crossbow, magnetism, computer mouse, powered flight, and the telephone are examples of inventions that were developed independently across different regions and time periods.

**Application**

Understanding simultaneous invention can help individuals appreciate the collaborative nature of innovation and discovery. It encourages humility in the face of groundbreaking achievements, acknowledging that success often arises from building upon the work of others rather than solely relying on individual genius. This perspective can foster a more open and cooperative approach to research and problem-solving.

**Related Models**

1. **Cultural Selection Theory**: This model studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner, focusing on how ideas, behaviors, and innovations spread and evolve within societies.

2. **Memetics**: The study of self-replicating units of culture that can be transmitted between individuals, helping to explain the spread and development of ideas, including scientific discoveries and inventions.

3. **Evolutionary Epistemology**: This approach applies concepts from biological evolution to the study of the growth of human knowledge, providing insights into how our understanding evolves and improves over time.
