# Circle of Competence

 **Introduction**

The Circle of Competence is a mental model that emphasizes investing and decision-making within one's area of expertise or knowledge, a concept popularized by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. By understanding and sticking to this circle, individuals can avoid making ill-informed decisions and increase their chances of success.

**Core Concept**

The Circle of Competence encourages focusing on areas where one has extensive knowledge and experience. This strategy aims to align an individual's subjective assessment with actual competence, ensuring that they invest or make decisions only when they have a deep understanding of the situation at hand. Buffett succinctly summed up this concept in his motto: "Know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

**Examples**

1. **Investing in Familiar Terrain**: Warren Buffett is known for investing in businesses he understands, such as Coca-Cola, American Express, and See's Candies. His familiarity with these companies stems from his understanding of their industries and business models, allowing him to make informed decisions.
2. **Andrew Carnegie's Focus on Iron and Steel**: In the late 19th century, industrialist Andrew Carnegie made his fortune by concentrating his efforts on the iron and steel industry. By focusing on this sector, he was able to develop a deep understanding of its inner workings, leading to successful investments and business ventures.
3. **Munger's Avoidance of Technology**: Charlie Munger has famously avoided investing in the technology sector, citing his lack of understanding as the primary reason. By acknowledging his limitations in this area, he has avoided potentially disastrous decisions that could have arisen from overconfidence or misinformation.

**Application**

The Circle of Competence can be applied in various aspects of life, not just investing. Whether you're making a career decision, purchasing a new product, or engaging in a hobby, it's essential to understand your circle of competence and stay within its boundaries. By doing so, you increase the likelihood of making informed decisions, reducing the risk of poor choices that could lead to financial loss or personal frustration.
